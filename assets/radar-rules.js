Improved Global Nonlinear Surface Mass Variation Estimates from Geodetic Displacements and Reconciliation with GRACE Data
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Spatiotemporal coverage gaps and the nature of distant signature sources in Global Navigations Satellite System (GNSS) and The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data require global inversions of data combinations for cross validation and complete and continuous monitoring of surface water mass variations. For spectral completeness, accurate data‐based degree‐1 surface mass variation coefficient or equivalent geocenter motion estimates are also desired but very difficult to obtain. To improve the reliability of such estimates, we carry out a new effort to combine different space geodetic technique data in a Kalman filter and time series approach to Terrestrial Reference Frame (TRF) realization using an advanced formulation. With origin at the center of mass of the Earth system (CM), the new parameterization now includes site displacements in the state vector explicitly for realistic assessment of their covariance matrices. More robust geocenter motion results are achieved when the displacement information is combined further with GRACE gravity data in a unified inversion. Previously, various systematic effects in GNSS data resulted in rather large discrepancies in global surface mass change estimates when compared with those from GRACE gravity data. Here, we show that significantly improved GNSS data after reprocessing and the refined Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) bottom pressure model reveal a global surface mass variation pattern that has been largely reconciled with that from GRACE data.

Effective pore fluid bulk modulus at patchy saturation: an analytic study
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract A patchy‐saturated two‐layered porous rock, with each layer filled with a different fluid is examined. We assume that this system is probed by an elastic wave having a wavelength much larger than the layers' thicknesses. We also assume that the diffusion length is smaller than the thickness of an individual layer, which implies hydraulic disconnection between layers. In the context of Gassmann's fluid substitution theory, we analytically derived an exact expression for the effective fluid bulk modulus assuming that both layers have the same porosity, dry‐frame, and mineral matrix properties.In addition we derived an approximate solution that works well at relatively high porosities. Both solutions are expressed as a weighted average of the arithmetic and harmonic averages of individual bulk moduli of the pore fluid. These weights are explicitly given as functions of the porosity, the fractional thicknesses of both layers and the elastic moduli of the constituents. For the approximate solution, one does not require explicit knowledge of the shear modulus of the rock. The comparison with laboratory data showed that, in the case where a porous, isotropic rock is filled with water and gas, the approximate solution can be used to model the measured data for high values of water saturation.

The upper mantle structure of northwestern Canada from teleseismic body wave tomography
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The Northern Canadian Cordillera (NCC) is an actively deforming orogenic belt in northwestern Canada. Geochemical and geophysical data show that the NCC is underlain by a thin and hot lithosphere, in contrast with the adjacent cold and thick cratonic lithosphere to the east. This juxtaposition of cold/hot and thick/thin lithosphere across a narrow transition zone has important implications for regional geodynamics. The recent deployment of USArray Transportable Array and other seismic stations across Alaska, USA and northwestern Canada, allows us to image lithosphere and upper mantle three‐dimensional seismic velocity structure at significantly improved resolution. Our model reveals a broad high‐velocity anomaly across northern Yukon and Northwest Territories, which is interpreted as buried cratonic lithosphere, and which we refer to as the Mackenzie craton. Another prominent high‐velocity anomaly is imaged beneath northeastern British Columbia and is interpreted to indicate cratonic lithosphere beneath the Northern Rocky Mountains. These two mechanically strong lithospheric blocks, also suggested by regional magnetic data, are interpreted to buttress the ends of the Mackenzie Mountains fold and thrust belt, guiding intervening cordilleran mantle flow toward the Canadian Shield and controlling the arcuate geometry of the Mackenzie Mountains fold and thrust belt. Both P‐ and S‐wave models also reveal the signature of a northward‐dipping, subducting Wrangell slab across the southern region of the Alaska/Yukon border. Strong P‐ and S‐wave velocity contrasts across the Tintina Fault suggest that it is a lithosphere‐scale shear zone that extends into the upper mantle beneath the NCC and demarcates distinct regions of lithospheric mantle.

Formulation of a Triaxial Three‐Layered Earth Rotation: Theory and Rotational Normal Mode Solutions
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract In this study, we formulated a triaxial three‐layered anelastic Earth rotation theory considering various core mantle couplings, including the pressure and gravitational couplings acting on the elastic inner core by the outer core and mantle, the viscoelectromagnetic couplings between the outer core and mantle, and between the outer and inner cores. With this formulation, using the eigenvalue method we solved four rotational normal modes, including the Chandler Wobble (CW), Free Core Nutation (FCN), Free Inner Core Nutation (FICN), and the Inner Core Wobble (ICW). The triaxiality of the actual Earth has a very small effect on rotational normal modes, i.e. 0.005, 0.0, ‐0.071, and 1.174 d respectively for the CW, FCN, FICN, and ICW. In the case that the triaxiality is bigger, for instance if the Earth's equatorial dynamical ellipticity were 5.22 x 10‐4, which is one order of magnitude larger than the presently determined ellipticity (2.2 x 10‐5), the CW and ICW periods will be lengthened by 3.579 d and 94.912 d, and the FICN period will be decreased by 0.59 d. Based on our present knowledge, the numerical solutions of the four normal modes under the new rotation frame suggest that the periods of CW, FCN, FICN and ICW are respectively 432.2, 429.9, 934.0, and 2718.7 d. Our theory for Earth can be extended to other planets in our solar system.

Combined effects of pressure and water saturation on the seismic anisotropy in artificial porous sandstone with aligned fractures
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Fractures are commonly existing in the subsurface rocks and understanding the seismic anisotropy in fractured rocks is of great importance in a range of geophysical applications. However, although all the fractured rocks are suffering from geological stresses and most of them are experiencing partial water saturation, the combined effects of confining pressure and water saturation on the seismic anisotropy in fractured rocks remain poorly understood. To obtain such knowledge, we measured and compared the anisotropic velocities and corresponding seismic anisotropy in two artificial porous sandstone samples with and without aligned fractures, respectively, as functions of varying confining pressure and degree of water saturation. We showed that the existence of aligned fractures significantly reduced the five measured velocities but dramatically enhanced the seismic anisotropy in the fractured sample. We also showed that confining pressure and water saturation had an inter‐dependent complex effect on the seismic anisotropy of the fractured sample. The seismic anisotropy of the dry sample showed the highest pressure sensitivity and the saturation effect was most significant at low confining pressure. Integrated interpretation of the experimental data indicated that wave‐induced fluid flow due to pore‐scale and mesoscale fluid distribution in the rocks are responsible for most of the observed pressure and saturation dependent anisotropic behaviors in the rocks. The results have helped to gain new knowledge on the seismic anisotropy in partially saturated fractured rocks subject to varying pressures and suggest the requirement for advanced theoretical models to fully understand the acquired data.

Mapping the 4‐dimensional viscosity field of an experimental lava flow
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Viscosity is a critical rheological property that determines the behavior, evolution, and final morphology of lava flows. Determining the viscosity of an active lava flow, however, is non‐trivial. The rheological structure of lava is complex, and during active flow conditions, viscosity can change by orders of magnitude through space and time. This makes viscosity one of the most elusive properties of flowing lava. After almost a century of research on lava viscosity, it is still common practice to reduce the viscosity of a flow to a single value, generalizing an immense field of deviations and complexities. Considering lava viscosity as a 1‐dimensional variable may be sufficient for characterizing some aspects of flows but it does not allow for solving higher‐order rheological problems, such as depth structure, spatial variability, or rates of change. This study presents, for the first time, the 4‐dimensional viscosity field of an actively flowing experimental lava. Results from this experiment include time‐series thickness, surface velocity, and temperature maps that are used to solve for the 4D viscosity of the lava flow with a spatial resolution of 2 cm. Additionally, the approach used in this study allows for an analysis of vertical rheological structure, specifically, crust and core viscosity layers. Although this study was performed in an experimental setting with crystal‐ and bubble‐free lava, the basic data collection techniques applied are common in field volcanology and thus could be applicable in certain natural settings.

Detailed structure of the subducted Nazca slab into the lower mantle derived from continent‐scale teleseismic P‐wave tomography
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Nazca subduction beneath South America is one of our best modern examples of long‐lived ocean‐continent subduction on the planet, serving as a foundation for our understanding of subduction processes. Within that framework, persistent heterogeneities at a range of scales in both the South America and Nazca plates is difficult to reconcile without detailed knowledge of the subducted Nazca slab structure. Here we use teleseismic traveltime residuals from >1,000 broadband and short period seismic stations across South America in a single tomographic inversion to produce the highest resolution contiguous P‐wave tomography model of the subducting slab and surrounding mantle beneath South America to date. Our model reveals a continuous trench‐parallel fast seismic velocity anomaly across the majority of South America that is consistent with the subducting Nazca slab. The imaged anomaly indicates a number of robust features of the subducted slab, including variable slab dip, extensive lower mantle penetration, slab stagnation in the lower mantle, and variable slab amplitude, that are incorporated into a new, comprehensive model of the geometry of the Nazca slab surface to ~1,100 km depth. Lower mantle slab penetration along the entire margin suggests that lower mantle slab anchoring is insufficient to explain along strike upper plate variability while slab stagnation in the lower mantle indicates that the 1,000 km discontinuity is dominant beneath South America.

The continually stable subduction, iron‐spin transition and the formation of LLSVPs from subducted oceanic crust
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) in the lower mantle beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean have been widely accepted as compositionally distinct zones characterized by their large spatial scale, distinctive geometry (high topography and steep side boundaries) and long‐term stability. One possible explanation for the chemical origin of the LLSVPs is that they formed from subducted oceanic crust. However, some previous geodynamic models suggest that it is difficult for a sufficient quantity of recycled crust to accumulate in the deep mantle and form chemical structures matching those of LLSVPs. Here, we show that the continually stable subduction can significantly enhance the gathering of recycled oceanic crust above the core‐mantle boundary. The resulting chemical structures in our model show high elevations and steep sides similar to those of the seismically observed LLSVPs when the effects of iron‐spin transition in ferropericlase are incorporated. These LLSVP‐like structures usually emerge 1~1.5 billion years (Gyr) after the model starts and remain recognizable at 3 Gyr. The total volume of these structures first increases to approximately double the current LLSVPs’ volume and then gradually decreases over time. With a subduction pattern corresponding to extroversion supercontinent cycles, two antipodal chemical structures form similar to the current LLSVPs and survive longer than 1 Gyr.

One possible explanation for the chemical origin of the LLSVPs is that they formed from subducted oceanic crust. However, some previous geodynamic models suggest that it is difficult for a sufficient quantity of recycled crust to accumulate in the deep mantle and form chemical structures matching those of LLSVPs. Here, we show that the continually stable subduction can significantly enhance the gathering of recycled oceanic crust above the core‐mantle boundary. The resulting chemical structures in our model show high elevations and steep sides similar to those of the seismically observed LLSVPs when the effects of iron‐spin transition in ferropericlase are incorporated. These LLSVP‐like structures usually emerge 1~1.5 billion years (Gyr) after the model starts and remain recognizable at 3 Gyr. The total volume of these structures first increases to approximately double the current LLSVPs’ volume and then gradually decreases over time. With a subduction pattern corresponding to extroversion supercontinent cycles, two antipodal chemical structures form similar to the current LLSVPs and survive longer than 1 Gyr.</p>

The 2008 eruptive unrest at Cerro Azul volcano (Galápagos) revealed by InSAR data and a method for geodetic modelling
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Cerro Azul is one of the most active volcanoes in the western Galápagos Islands, but its unrest episodes are poorly studied. Here unrest, which started in 2007, culminated in two eruptive phases from May 29th to June 11th 2008. We investigate this unrest and the associated eruptions using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data and geodetic modelling. To overcome the unwrapping errors affecting some of our InSAR data we invert the wrapped phase directly by estimating the integer ambiguities simultaneously with the geophysical parameters. Our results highlight how the eruption was preceded by long‐term pre‐eruptive inflation (October 2007 – April 2008). During the first eruptive phase, most of the magma responsible for the inflation fed the lateral propagation of a radial dike, which caused a first deflation of the magmatic reservoir. During the second eruptive phase, the further lateral propagation of the dike fed a radial eruptive fissure at the base of the edifice, causing further deflation of the magmatic reservoir. From the first to the second eruptive phase, the radial dike changed its strike propagating towards a topographic low between Cerro Azul and Sierra Negra.

A Block Model of Present‐Day Kinematics of Alaska and Western Canada
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We present an updated GPS velocity field for Alaska and western Canada and use it to develop the first regionally comprehensive tectonic block model for the area based on modern geodetic data. The greatest tectonic influences along the southern margin are the translation, collision, and flat slab subduction of the Yakutat block and subduction of the Pacific plate. Northward‐directed velocities surrounding the Yakutat collisional front are consistent with indenter‐related deformation while southcentral Alaska is undergoing a counterclockwise rotation. Westerly velocities in western Alaska and along the Aleutian forearc suggest that crustal material is escaping into the Bering Sea region. The majority of relative plate motion is taken up along major boundary faults, but right lateral‐strike slip faults in interior and western Alaska accommodate part of the motion. Escape tectonics in western Alaska extends as far north as the Kaltag fault. We observe significant motion relative to North America in every part of Alaska, including the North Slope. Evidence of localized right‐lateral shear between the Totschunda and Fairweather faults suggests that strain transfer into interior Alaska has moved away from the eastern Denali‐Chatham Strait system to a more direct corridor. Observed deformation in southcentral Alaska indicates that locked portions of the Yakutat flat slab extend further east and north than previously estimated.

Sea level rise in New Zealand: The effect of vertical land motion on century‐long tide gauge records in a tectonically active region
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Historically tide gauge (TG) data have been used to estimate global sea level rise. Critical to the analysis of TG records is the assumption that the TG sites are stable and not affected by vertical land motion (VLM). We analyze century long tide gauge records from New Zealand that have been affected by VLM due to both major and transient earthquake events at a regional level as well as local instabilities. Using combined GPS and precise levelling, we estimate relative VLM between the GPS and TG of up to 1 mm/yr. Based on 15‐20 years of GPS data, the effect of seismic activity and slow slip events has uplifted sites by up to 0.8 mm/yr on average in Wellington and Dunedin. Updated estimates of long‐term relative sea level (RSL) at four New Zealand tide gauges, as well as an estimate of RSL at a new fifth TG (New Plymouth), are determined using data through 2013 ‐ an additional 13 years compared to the previous study. The VLM corrected RSL rates gives our best estimate absolute sea level (ASL) of +1.45 ± 0.28 mm/yr [1891−2013]. It is important that ASL derived from RSL rates include realistic estimates of VLM, especially at TG sites that are close to plate boundaries, located in seismically active regions, affected by glacial isostatic adjustment, land ice loss or gas/oil/water extraction.

Seasonal and Long‐term Groundwater Unloading in the Central Valley Modifies Crustal Stress
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Changes in terrestrial water content cause elastic deformation of the Earth's crust. This deformation is thought to play a role in modulating crustal stress and seismicity in regions where large water storage fluctuations occur. Groundwater is an important component of total water storage change in California, helping to drive annual water storage fluctuations and loss during periods of drought. Here, we use direct estimates of groundwater volume loss during the 2007‐2010 drought in California's Central Valley obtained from high resolution InSAR‐based vertical land motion data to investigate the effect of groundwater volume change on the evolution of the stress field. We show that GPS‐derived elastic load models may not capture the contribution of groundwater to terrestrial water loading, resulting in an underestimation of non‐tectonic crustal stress change. We find that groundwater unloading during the drought causes Coulomb stress change of up to 5.5 kPa and seasonal fluctuations of up to 2.6 kPa at seismogenic depth. We find that faults near the Valley show the largest stress change and the San Andreas fault experiences only ~40 Pa Coulomb stress change over the course of a year from groundwater storage change. Annual Coulomb stress peaks dominantly in the fall, when the groundwater level is low, however some faults experience peak stress in the spring when groundwater levels are higher. Additionally, we find that periods of increased stress correlate with higher than average seismic moment release, but are not correlated with an increase in the number of earthquakes. This indicates groundwater loading likely contributes to non‐tectonic loading of faults, especially near the Valley edge, but is not a dominant factor in modulation of seismicity in California because the amplitude of stress change declines rapidly with distance from the Valley. By carefully quantifying and spatially locating groundwater fluctuations, we will improve our understanding of what drives non‐tectonic stress and forces that modulate seismicity in California.

Self‐potential ambient noise and spectral relationship with urbanization, seismicity, and strain rate revealed via the Taiwan Geoelectric Monitoring Network
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Geoelectric self‐potential (SP) signals are sensitive to natural and anthropogenic factors. The SP spectral characteristics under the different factors in Taiwan were investigated and the SP spectral scalings were correlated with urbanization level, seismicity, and crustal deformation. The ambient SP noise models were first established by estimating the probability density functions of the spectrograms at each frequency. The effects of the natural and anthropogenic factors on the SP signals are understood by comparing the SP noise models under various conditions, such as precipitation, urbanization, and electric trains. Results show that the SP signals in areas of high industrialization and human activity and areas close to train stations behave as white noises and exhibit a distinct spectral ripple at frequencies around 1 Hz. On the other hand, the SP spectral power‐law parameters, Gutenberg‐Richter (GR) b values, and dilation strain rates were estimated by using the SP, earthquake catalog, and GPS data, respectively, during 2012–2017. By investigating the correlations of the SP spectral parameters with the GR b value, dilation strain rates, and urbanization level, the SP optimal frequency band is found between 0.006 and 1 Hz due to the high correlation between the SP and seismicity data and between the SP and dilation data and the low correlation between the SP and urbanization data. Hence, this study may help the filtering and screening of the SP data and facilitate the understanding of the mechano‐electric behavior in the crust.

<title>Topographic fingerprint of deep mantle subduction</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The dynamic topography links with the mantle structures at various temporal and spatial scales. However, it is still unclear how it relates to the dynamics of subducting lithosphere when plates reach the mantle transition zone and lower mantle. Seismic tomography images show how slab morphologies vary from sinking sub‐vertically into the lower mantle, to lying flat above the upper‐lower mantle discontinuity, to thickening in the shallow lower mantle. These slab shapes have been considered to be the result of variable interaction of the slab with the upper‐lower mantle discontinuity at ~670 km depth. Previous studies show that periodic deep slab dynamics can explain a variety of enigmatic geological and geophysical observations such as periodic variations of the plate velocities, trench retreat and advance episodes and the scattered distribution of slab dip angle in the upper mantle. In this study, we use two‐dimensional subduction models to investigate the surface topography expression and its evolution during slab transition zone interaction. Our models show that topography does not depend on slab morphology; indeed, the dynamic topography cannot distinguish between a slab sinking straight into the lower mantle and slab stagnation at the upper‐lower mantle boundary. However, topographic oscillations are related to episodes of the trench advance and retreat, which in turn are linked to the slab folding behaviour at transition zone depths. Our results suggest that the surface transient signal observed by geological studies could help to detect deep subduction dynamics.

ITRF2014, Earth figure changes, and geocenter velocity: implications for GIA and recent ice melting
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Using a selection of GNSS vertical velocities from the latest solution of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame ITRF2014, we calculate the degree‐1 and degree‐2 Spherical Harmonics Coefficients (SHC) of the solid Earth figure changes at different dates, with realistic errors that take into account the inhomogeneity of the network. We find that the SHC are globally close to zero except the zonal coefficients, which show values notably larger than those derived from different Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) models, and which have tended to increase during the timespan of observations. We show that these differences are most probably due to global Recent Ice Melting (RIM). Assuming elastic RIM deformation, we then investigate the Earth's geocenter velocity and the geoid oblateness time evolution (J2‐rate) derived from our SHC estimations. The obtained geocenter velocity reaches 0.9 ± 0.5 mm/yr in 2013 with a Z‐component of 0.8 ± 0.4 mm/yr, which is slightly larger than previous estimations. We compare our J2‐rate estimations with observations. Our estimations show a similar acceleration in J2 after 2000. However, our estimates are notably larger than the observations. This indicates either that the J2‐rate due to GIA processes is lower than expected (as proposed by Nakada et al., 2015, 2016), or that the deformation induced by RIM is not purely elastic, or both. Finally, we show that viscous relaxation or phase transitions in the mantle transition zone may only partly explain this discrepancy. This raises the question of the accuracy of current mass estimations of RIM and GIA models.

This indicates either that the <span> <i>J</i> <sub>2</sub> </span> <b>‐</b>rate due to GIA processes is lower than expected (as proposed by Nakada et al., 2015, 2016), or that the deformation induced by RIM is not purely elastic, or both.

Quantifying the uncertainty of a coupled plume and tephra dispersal model: PLUME‐MOM/HYSPLIT simulations applied to Andean volcanoes
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Numerical modelling of tephra dispersal and deposition is essential for evaluation of volcanic hazards. Many models consider reasonable physical approximations in order to reduce computational times, but this may introduce a certain degree of uncertainty in the simulation outputs. The important step of uncertainty quantification is dealt in this paper with respect to a coupled version of a plume model (PLUME‐MoM) and a tephra dispersal model (HYSPLIT). The performances of this model are evaluated through simulations of four past eruptions of different magnitudes and styles from three Andean volcanoes, and the uncertainty is quantified by evaluating the differences between modeled and observed data of plume height (at different time steps above the vent) as well as mass loading and grain size at given stratigraphic sections. Different meteorological datasets were also tested and had a sensible influence on the model outputs. Other results highlight that the model tends to underestimate plume heights while overestimating mass loading values, especially for higher magnitude eruptions. Moreover, the advective part of HYSPLIT seems to work more efficiently than the diffusive part. Finally, though the coupled PLUME‐MoM/HYSPLIT model generally is less efficient in reproducing deposit grain sizes, we propose it may be used for hazard maps production for higher magnitude eruptions (sub‐Plinian or Plinian) for what concern mass loading.

Impact Experiment on Gneiss: The Effects of Foliation on Cratering Process
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Two impact experiments were carried out on blocks of Maggia gneiss to assess the influence of mechanical target anisotropies on the cratering process. The experiments were done within the framework of Multidisciplinary Experimental and Modeling Impact Research Network. In one experiment the metamorphic foliation was vertical, that is, oriented perpendicular to the target surface, and in the other horizontal, that is, parallel to the target surface. This study reveals that due to preferred spallation along the foliation, the cratering efficiency is higher if the foliation is horizontal. The study further presents a comprehensive quantitative strain analysis in the subsurface of these craters. We use biotite kink bands as strain markers. The distribution of strain differs strongly in both experiments. If the foliation is vertical, the area beneath the central crater floor shows a high compressive strain. This is attributed to the ability of biotite to kink more easily when shortened parallel to its basal plane. If the foliation is horizontal, surface kinking is reduced and tensile failure along the foliation deepens the crater during unloading.

Radiometric Temperature Measurements in Nongray Ferropericlase With Pressure‐ Spin‐ and Temperature‐Dependent Optical Properties
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Accurate temperature determination is central to measurements of physical and chemical properties in laser‐heated (LH) diamond anvil cells (DACs). Because the optical properties of samples at high pressure‐temperature (P‐T) conditions are generally unknown, virtually all LH DAC studies employ the graybody assumption (i.e., wavelength‐independent emissivity and absorptivity). Here we test the adequacy of this assumption for ferropericlase (13 mol.% Fe), the second most abundant mineral in the Earth's lower mantle. We model the wavelength‐dependent emission and absorption of thermal radiation in samples of variable geometry and with absorption coefficients experimentally constrained at lower mantle P and P‐T. The graybody assumption in LH DAC experiments on nongray ferropericlase contributes moderate systematic errors within ±200 K at 40, 75, and 135 GPa and T < 2300 K for all plausible sample geometries. However, at core‐mantle boundary P‐T conditions (135 GPa, 4000 K) the graybody assumption may underestimate the peak temperature in the DAC by up to 600 K in self‐insulated samples due to selective light attenuation in highly opaque ferropericlase. Our results allow insights into the apparent discrepancy between available ferropericlase melting studies and offer practical guidance for accurate measurements of its solidus in LH DACs. More generally, the results of this work demonstrate that reliable temperature measurements in LH DACs require that the optical and geometrical properties of the samples are established.

The formation of continental fragments in subduction settings: the importance of structural inheritance and subduction system dynamics
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Microcontinents and continental fragments are pieces of continental lithosphere, formed by extension and break‐up, followed by plate boundary relocations. Microcontinents or continental fragments affiliated with passive margins are well documented, but those close to active margins are less studied. We use dynamic 2D and 3D numerical experiments to investigate how pre‐existing weaknesses within a continental upper plate affect extension and the possible formation of continental fragments. Our parametric study of the configuration (width and viscosity) of this imposed weakness indicates that stress localization and break‐up of the upper plate are most efficient for narrow weak zones and a viscosity contrast between the weak zone and the surrounding crust of at least one order of magnitude. Moreover, upper plate extension and break‐up occurs only if extension has a rotational component, here caused by the presence of a continental indenter on the downgoing plate. The width of the indenter relative to oceanic part of the downgoing plate controls differential slab pull that triggers trench retreat and upper plate deformation. A downgoing plate with a relatively large continental indenter yields large enough slab rotation to detach a continental block from the overriding plate and form wide back‐arc basins. Variations in the weak zone angle with respect to the trench result in different basin geometries. We successfully modelled the first step in break‐up of active continental margins and determined the settings that may facilitate microcontinent formation in a subduction framework.

Effect of fluid viscosity on fault reactivation and co‐seismic weakening
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract High‐viscosity fluids are often used during hydraulic fracking operations in geo‐reservoirs. Here, we performed dedicated experiments to study the influence of fluid viscosity on fault reactivation and associated induced earthquakes. Experiments were conducted in the rotary‐shear machine SHIVA on experimental fault of Westerly Granite saturated by fluids with increasing viscosity (at room temperature) from 0.1 mPa.s (water) to 1.2 Pa.s (99% glycerol). Fault reactivation was triggered at constant effective normal‐stress by increasing the shear stress acting on the fault. Our results showed that independent of the viscosity, fault reactivation followed a Coulomb‐failure criterion. Instead, fluid viscosity affected the fault weakening mechanism: flash‐heating was the dominant weakening mechanism in room‐humidity and water‐saturated conditions, whereas the presence of more viscous fluids favored the activation of elasto‐hydrodynamic lubrication. Independent of the weakening mechanism, the breakdown work Wb dissipated during seismic faulting increased with slip U following a power law (Wb ∝ U 1.25) in agreement with seismological estimates of natural and induced earthquakes.

Integrating Reservoir Dynamics, Crustal Stress, and Geophysical Observations of the Laguna del Maule Magmatic System by FEM Models and Data Assimilation
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The Laguna del Maule volcanic field is a large rhyolitic magmatic system in the Chilean Andes, which has exhibited frequent eruptions during the past 20 ka. Rapid surface uplift (>20 cm/year) has been observed since 2007 accompanied by localized earthquake swarms and microgravity changes, indicating the inflating magma reservoir may interact with a preexisting weak zone (i.e., Troncoso fault). In this investigation, we model the magma reservoir by data assimilation with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data. The reservoir geometry is comparable to the magma body inferred by seismic tomography, magnetotelluric, and gravity studies. The models also suggest that a weak zone, which has little effect on surface displacement, is important as a fluid transport channel to promote earthquakes and microgravity changes. In particular, concentrated dilatancy within the weak zone facilitates the microfracture formation during reservoir inflation. High‐pressure fluid can inject into the weak zone from the magma reservoir to trigger earthquakes and further migrate upward to create positive gravity changes by occupying unsaturated storages. The pore pressure will then decrease, halting the seismicity swarm until the next cycle. This “hydrofracturing” process may release some accumulated stress along the magma reservoir delaying an eventual eruption in turn. Besides, the resultant models are propagated forward in time to evaluate potential stress trajectories for future unrest.

Separating Sea and Slow Slip Signals on the Seafloor
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Seafloor pressure measurements hold promise for estimating vertical displacements from transient slow slip events on submarine faults. We assess the accuracy of pressure offset estimates that evolve over days to weeks and the confidence with which they may be attributed to tectonic deformation or to the ocean water column. One common approach to resolve this ambiguity assumes water column pressures vary insignificantly over the study region and are represented by stable reference site pressures. Assessing the validity of this assumption requires independent evidence. Correlations between pressures and colocated temperatures collected during the Hikurangi Ocean Bottom Investigation of Tremor and Slow Slip experiment suggest temperatures might provide a useful independent proxy for water column pressures. We compared offsets estimated using several methods, with temperature and other proxies. The use of a temperature proxy was unsuccessful, because seafloor temperatures did not track the seasonal signal that contributes significantly to seafloor pressure changes over the slow slip event period. Regardless of the estimation method, offsets varied within a few cm around some uncertain reference level. Commonly used statistical measures are shown not to be reliable indicators of offset accuracy since offsets contribute minimally to the total variance. Offsets estimated using identical methods but with seafloor pressures simulated using a regional ocean model were larger than those derived from the data but had a similar pattern. Since the model simulates only water column processes, this suggests a significant fraction of the estimated pressure offsets are due to seasonal water column signal and are not of tectonic origin.

Lithospheric Structure of Northwestern Venezuela From Wide‐Angle Seismic Data: Implications for the Understanding of Continental Margin Evolution
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Northwestern Venezuela is located in the complex deformation zone between the Caribbean and South American plates. Several models regarding the lithospheric structure of the Mérida Andes have been proposed. Nevertheless, they lack relevant structural information in order to support the interpretation of deeper structures. Therefore, a 560‐km‐long refraction profile across the northern part of Mérida Andes, oriented in a NNW direction, covering areas from the Proterozoic basement in the south, to both Paleozoic and Meso‐Cenozoic terranes of northwestern Venezuela to the north, is analyzed in this contribution.

<h2>Abstract</h2> <p>Northwestern Venezuela is located in the complex deformation zone between the Caribbean and South American plates. Several models regarding the lithospheric structure of the Mérida Andes have been proposed. Nevertheless, they lack relevant structural information in order to support the interpretation of deeper structures. Therefore, a 560‐km‐long refraction profile across the northern part of Mérida Andes, oriented in a NNW direction, covering areas from the Proterozoic basement in the south, to both Paleozoic and Meso‐Cenozoic terranes of northwestern Venezuela to the north, is analyzed in this contribution. Thirteen land shots were recorded by 545 short‐deployment seismometers, constraining <i>P</i> wave velocity models from first‐arrival seismic tomography and layer‐based inversion covering the whole crust in detail, with some hints to upper mantle structures. The most prominent features imaged are absence of a crustal root associated to the Mérida Andes, as the Northern Andes profile is located marginal to the Andean crustal domain, and low‐angle subduction of the Caribbean oceanic slab (~10–20°) beneath northwestern South America. Further crustal structures identified in the profile are (a) crustal thinning beneath the Falcón Basin along the western extension of the Oca‐Ancón fault system interpreted as a back‐arc basin; (b) suture zones between both the Proterozoic and Paleozoic provinces (Ouachita‐Marathon‐related suture?), and Paleozoic and Meso‐Cenozoic terranes (peri‐Caribbean suture) interpreted from lateral changes in seismic velocity; and (c) evidence of a deep Paleozoic(?) extensional basin, underlying thick Mesozoic and Cenozoic sequences (beneath the Guárico area).</p>

Optimizing Sensor Configurations for the Detection of Slow‐Slip Earthquakes in Seafloor Pressure Records, Using the Cascadia Subduction Zone as a Case Study
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We present seafloor pressure records from the Cascadia Subduction Zone, alongside oceanographic and geophysical models, to evaluate the spatial uniformity of bottom pressure and optimize the geometry of sensor networks for resolving offshore slow‐slip transients. Seafloor pressure records from 2011 to 2015 show that signal amplitudes are depth‐dependent, with tidally filtered and detrended root‐mean‐squares of <2 cm on the abyssal plain and >6 cm on the continental shelf. This is consistent with bottom pressure predictions from circulation models and comparable to deformation amplitudes from offshore slow slip observed in other subduction zones. We show that the oceanographic component of seafloor pressure can be reduced to ≤1‐cm root‐mean‐square by differencing against a reference record from a similar depth, under restrictions that vary with depth. Instruments at 100–250 m require depths matched within 10 m at separations of <100 km, while locations deeper than 1,400 m are broadly comparable over separations of at least 300 km. Despite the significant noise reduction from this method, no slow slip was identified in the dataset, possibly due to poor spatiotemporal instrument coverage, nonideal deployment geometry, and limited depth‐matched instruments. We use forward predictions of deformation from elastic half‐space models and hindcast pressure from circulation models to generate synthetic slow‐slip observational records and show that a range of slip scenarios produce resolvable signals under depth‐matched differencing. For future detection of offshore slow slip in Cascadia, we recommend a geometry in which instruments are deployed along isobaths to optimize corrections for oceanographic signals.

Carbon Partitioning Between the Earth's Inner and Outer Core
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Knowledge of the abundance and distribution of light elements in the core is fundamental to the understanding of the Earth and other planetary systems. Recent studies (Li et al., 2018; Mashino et al., 2019) suggest the particular importance of carbon for explaining core properties, yet knowledge of carbon partitioning between the outer and inner core is unknown. By using the quasiharmonic approximation, ab initio molecular dynamics, and thermodynamic integration techniques, we have computed the chemical potential of carbon in liquid Fe and solid hcp‐Fe at core conditions. We find that substitutional carbon is more stable than interstitial carbon and other carbon defect cluster structures in solid Fe. Lattice strain and overcoordination effects lead to a high chemical potential of C in solid Fe compared to the liquid, and consequently carbon partitions almost completely into the liquid. We find that carbon can account for most of the density jump at the inner‐core boundary. This provides an alternative mechanism to the necessity of an oxygen‐rich outer core and may have significant implications for the composition and structure of the deep Earth.

Using Rigid Microplate Motions to Detect the Stress Buildup Preceding Large Earthquakes: A Feasibility Test Based on Synthetic Models
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Assessing the temporal evolution of stresses along seismogenic faults is typically done by combining geodetic observations collected near the locations of previous large earthquakes with modeling of the interseismic, coseismic, and postseismic deformation. Here we explore whether it is feasible to link the charge phase of large earthquakes to rigid microplate motions, which can be inferred from geodetic observations that are instead collected further away from crustal faults. We use numerical simulations of the dynamics and associated kinematics of an idealized, rigid microplate subject to stress buildups and drop‐offs from a series of earthquakes. Simulations span the charging cycle of a single earthquake. Several earthquakes distributed according to the Gutenberg‐Richter law occur meanwhile. We use large ensembles of simulations featuring randomly‐generated earthquake hypocenters and make statistical assessments of the fraction of model time needed for the microplate motions to depart from the initial one to a degree that is larger than typical geodetic uncertainties and for at least 90% of the remaining time before the large earthquake occurs. We find such a fraction (i) to be only one tenth in simulations that do feature a large earthquake, (ii) to be longer in simulations that do not, and (iii) to remain small for realistic microplate geometries and asthenosphere viscosity/thickness values. Our inferences hold also when we simulate geodetic time series shorter than the large earthquake cycle and even when we assume that only half of the stress buildup affects the microplate rigid motion.

Impact of Estimating Position Offsets on the Uncertainties of GNSS Site Velocity Estimates
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We study the impact of estimating offsets within GNSS position time series on the uncertainties of site velocity estimates. Site velocity uncertainties are estimated by assuming different observational noise types, including white noise, fractal white noise, flicker noise, first‐order Gauss‐Markov noise, random walk, fractal random walk, and mixture of flicker noise, and white noise. For each noise type, we assess the sensitivity of the velocity uncertainty to offsets numerically by computing the inflation rate of the uncertainty as the number of offset parameters increases. We show that the sensitivity reduces when the noise becomes more temporally correlated. For the mixture of flicker noise plus white noise, which has been concluded as an appropriate noise model for the majority of current GNSS position time series, the rate uncertainty increases by about 11% as the number of offset parameters doubles from 1 to 2 provided that the white noise does not dominate the flicker noise. Based on the analysis of the Plate Boundary Observatory position time series, we find that adding one additional offset parameter would increase the median velocity standard deviation by 14%, consistent with the result of the simulation study. Such increase is much smaller than the conclusion of a 40% by a previous study. Therefore, given the noise characteristics of current GNSS site position estimates, position offsets have limited impact on uncertainties of site velocity estimates. This result implies that improving instrumentation, even though may introduce position offsets, is the best approach for improving reference frame stability.

Delayed Subevents During the MW6.2 First Shock of the 2016 Kumamoto, Japan, Earthquake
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Earthquakes have been considered mostly to generate concentric rupture starting from the hypocenter. On the other hand, delayed subevents occurring after the first passage of rupture front have been found in the recent earthquakes, for example, the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. They potentially cause a long duration of ground motions. We study a source rupture process during the Mw6.2 first shock of the 2016 Kumamoto, Japan, earthquake, which may include the delayed subevent. The source model with three segments (S1, S2, and S3) is estimated from the near source records by using Bayesian inference, Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The maximum a posteriori solution well explains the near source records, and its layout of S1 and S2 segments are consistent with the previous studies. The posterior distribution suggests that location of S1 and S3 segments spatially overlaps with a time interval of about 6–7 s. Therefore, the S3 segment is accepted as the delayed subevent in this event. The first rupture on S1 concentrically propagates to trigger the second rupture on S2, and the second rupture then causes the dynamic triggering of S3 segment. Physical background how the delayed subevents can release the stress is needed to investigate in the future.

Collapse of Reacted Fracture Surface Decreases Permeability and Frictional Strength
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Geochemical and geomechanical perturbations of the subsurface caused by the injection of fluids present risks of leakage and seismicity. This study investigated how acidic fluid flow affects hydraulic and frictional properties of fractures using experiments with 3.8‐cm‐long specimens of Eagle Ford shale, a laminated shale with carbonate‐rich strata. In low‐pressure flow cells, one set of samples was exposed to acidic brine and another set was exposed to neutral brine. X‐ray computed tomography and energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy revealed that samples exposed to acidic brine were calcite‐depleted and had developed a porous altered layer, while the other set showed no evidence of alteration. After reaction, samples were compressed and sheared in a triaxial cell that supplied normal stress and differential pore pressure at prescribed sliding velocities, independently measuring friction and permeability. During the initial compression, the porous altered layer collapsed into fine particles that filled the fracture. This effectively impeded flow and sealed the fracture, resulting in fracture permeability to decrease 1 to 2 orders of magnitude relative to the unaltered fractures. This is a favorable outcome in subsurface applications where the goal is to reduce leakage risks. However, during shear the reacted fracture had lower frictional strength because the fine‐grained particles in the collapsed layer prevented the formation of interlocking microasperities. Therefore, coupled geochemical and geomechanical processes that could favorably seal fractures could also increase the likelihood of induced seismicity. These findings have important implications for geological carbon sequestration, pressurized fluid energy storage, geothermal energy, and other subsurface technologies.

Including Plastic Strain Into the Discrete Preisach‐Mayergoyz Space: Application to Granular Media
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The Preisach‐Mayergoyz (PM) model describes hysteretic behavior in several fields. For fractured rocks, a discretized version of the PM model successfully models nonlinear hysteretic elasticity under multiple loading cycles. In addition to hysteresis, granular media are subjected to large irreversible (plastic) deformation. To account for plastic deformation, we propose a modification of the PM density matrix, in which we include negative opening pressure. We associate negative opening pressure with rearrangements of the contact network. We apply the model to three sand samples undergoing multiple isotropic loading cycles. Calibrating the model parameters from quasi‐static measurements of volumetric deformation, we estimate the quality of prediction of the dynamic bulk modulus. When this elastoplastic PM model is compared to the classic PM model, strong improvements are found both in matching the strain path and in the estimation of the dynamic bulk modulus.

An Experimental Study of Matrix Dissolution and Wormhole Formation Using Gypsum Core Flood Tests: 1. Permeability Evolution and Wormhole Geometry Analysis
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Core flood tests were conducted to study the effect of flow rate on the dissolution of the gypsum rock matrix and the formation of wormholes. An effluent chemistry monitoring system was designed and integrated into a triaxial system to provide continuous effluent concentration measurements, in addition to the pressure and flow measurements during the core flood tests. X‐ray computed tomography (CT) was used to study the geometry of the wormholes after the tests. The core flood tests showed agreement with experiments reported in the literature regarding permeability evolution and wormhole breakthrough. By continuously monitoring the effluent concentration, the effluent chemistry monitoring system advanced the experimental study by showing how the dissolution kinetics evolved with the formation of wormholes. Three‐dimensional topological and morphological algorithms were developed to analyze the CT data and provide quantitative descriptions for the wormhole geometry. The CT analysis showed that higher flow rates resulted in more complex wormhole geometries regarding the number of wormholes and branches.

An Experimental Study of Matrix Dissolution and Wormhole Formation Using Gypsum Core Flood Tests: 2. Dissolution Kinetics and Modeling
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract In the parallel paper by Li et al. (2019; https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JB017238), an effluent chemistry monitoring system was designed and used in core flood experiments to continuously measure the effluent concentration and study the evolution of the rock‐fluid system. In this study, the results from the parallel paper were used for interpretation and modeling of the dissolution and wormhole formation. Based on the behavior of the effluent concentration, two transient states and two quasi‐steady states were defined to describe the dissolution in the rock‐fluid system. Dimensional analysis was used to identify the controlling mechanisms of the dissolution and transport in the matrix and the wormholes. The dimensional analysis showed that the dissolution in the matrix was reaction controlled, while the dissolution in the wormholes was diffusion controlled. It also showed that the rock‐fluid system evolved from reaction‐controlled dissolution to diffusion‐controlled dissolution during the core flood tests. A continuum model and the extended Graetz solution were used to model the dissolution in the matrix and in the wormholes, respectively. In the continuum model, this study estimates the effective surface area as a function of the flow rate (injection flux), to account for the effect of flow conditions on dissolution. Finally, a semiempirical model combining the continuum model and the extended Graetz solution was developed to simulate the formation of wormholes and the evolution of the dissolution kinetics during core flood tests.

Saturation Hysteresis Effects on the Seismic Signatures of Partially Saturated Heterogeneous Porous Rocks
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Experimental evidence indicates that the spatial distribution of immiscible pore fluids in partially saturated media depends on the flow history and, thus, exhibits hysteresis effects. To date, most works concerned with modelling the effective seismic properties of partially saturated rocks either disregard these effects or account for them employing oversimplified approaches. This, in turn, can lead to erroneous interpretations of the corresponding seismic signatures. In this work, we present a novel methodology that allows to compute hysteresis effects on seismic attenuation and velocity dispersion due to mesoscopic wave‐induced fluid flow in realistic scenarios. For this purpose, we first employ a constitutive model that conceptualizes a porous medium as a bundle of constrictive capillary tubes with a fractal pore‐size distribution, which allows to estimate local hydraulic properties and capillary pressure‐saturation hysteretic relationships in a heterogeneous rock sample. Then, we use a numerical upscaling procedure based on Biot's poroelasticity theory to compute seismic attenuation and velocity dispersion curves during drainage and imbibition cycles. By combining these procedures, we are able to model, for the first time, key features of the saturation field and of the seismic signatures commonly observed in the laboratory during drainage and imbibition experiments. Our results also show that the pore‐scale characteristics of a given porous medium, such as the pore‐throat geometry, can greatly influence the hysteresis effects on the seismic signatures.

Inverse Magnetic Susceptibility Fabrics in Pelagic Sediment: Implications for Magnetofossil Abundance and Alignment
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Single‐domain magnetite particles exhibit minimum susceptibility along their elongation, resulting in so‐called inverse fabric of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS). We report the discovery of inverse AMS fabrics from pelagic clay recovered by a ∼12 m long piston core from the western North Pacific. A previous study identified fossil single‐domain magnetite produced by magnetotactic bacteria (magnetofossils) as the dominant ferrimagnetic mineral in the sediment. The inverse AMS fabrics were found in a ∼2 m zone. The ∼6 and ∼4 m of sediment above and below this zone showed normal, horizontal AMS fabrics. Rock magnetic data and ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that magnetofossils account for most of the mean susceptibility regardless of normal or inverse AMS. This was explained by the mixing models where the inverse fabric from magnetofossils is nearly balanced by the normal fabrics of terrigenous minerals. The corrected degree of AMS carried by magnetofossils in the sediment was estimated to be ∼1.01, which is comparable to that of typical pelagic sediment at shallow depth. On the other hand, terrigenous minerals in the sediment were estimated to have higher degree of anisotropy, possibly reflecting burial and subsequent erosion of >80 m of sediment, which was also suggested by a subbottom acoustic stratigraphy. This suggests that inverse AMS fabrics due to magnetofossils may be widespread in pelagic clay without strong compaction.

Surface Motions and Continental Deformation in the Indian Plate and the India‐Eurasia Collision Zone
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The collision of the Indian plate with Eurasia has played a major role in controlling the dynamics of central Asia leading to the world's largest continental deformation zone. In order to study the deformation within the Indian plate as well as the India‐Eurasia collision zone, we model the lithospheric stress field by calculating the two primary sources of stress, one arising due to topography and shallow lithospheric structure estimated by gravitational potential energy differences and the other arising from basal tractions derived from density‐driven mantle convection. We use several tomography models to calculate horizontal tractions using the convection code HC for two radially varying viscosity structures. We also take into account lateral viscosity variations in the lithosphere model arising from stiff cratons, weak plate boundaries, and strength variations due to old and young oceanic lithosphere. We do a quantitative comparison of our predicted deviatoric stresses, strain rates, and plate velocities with surface observables and find that the regional tomography model of Singh et al. (2014) embedded in the global S wave model S40RTS does a remarkable job of fitting the observations of GPS velocities and strain rates as well as intraplate stress field from the World Stress Map.

Mapping the 3‐D Lithospheric Structure of the Greater Permian Basin in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico for Earthquake Monitoring
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The Greater Permian Basin is not only a complex tectonic regime, but it has also been and continues to be a productive oilfield where the seismicity rate in the basin has significantly increased since 2008. Since 2015, our understanding of the seismogenesis in the basin has increased owing to the establishment of a statewide seismic network known as TexNet for monitoring earthquake activities. A crucial component of improving the accuracy of the hypocentral location is an accurate velocity model that can better confirm the existing regional tectonic regime. We collected data from current TexNet operations and previously deployed seismic arrays and performed a joint local and teleseismic earthquake tomographic inversion, resulting in a three‐dimensional tomography model for earthquake monitoring. The preferred three‐dimensional tomography model includes a prominent feature at a depth range of 0–20 km, where distinct lower wave speed anomalies overlap with the surface trace of the Delaware Basin. These anomalies suggest a basin‐scale lithological difference from surrounding regions and corroborate basin characteristics. Findings also suggest that the Midland Basin may be more lithologically uniform than the Delaware Basin. A strong correlation exists between dense seismicity clusters and the obtained lower Vp/Vs ratios. Four significant clusters having Vp/Vs ratios ranging from 1.689 to 1.720 were identified. Using the Vp/Vs ratio as a proxy to evaluate the state of the pore‐fluid pressure, we think this spatial correlation suggests that the Greater Permian Basin currently comprises overpressurized fluid‐filled host rocks.

Nonlinear Interaction of High‐Frequency Seismic Waves With Sliding Fault Planes
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Slip during large crustal earthquakes continues for extended periods of time on spatially extensive fault planes. High‐frequency body waves from other parts of the fault system thus impinge on patches of the fault that are still actively sliding. Intuitively, the material within sliding fault planes does not rheologically distinguish between the low‐frequency stresses driving the gross earthquake and high‐frequency dynamic stresses from impinging body waves. Nonlinear interaction occurs, interrogating the rheology of the fault plane. High‐frequency S waves nonlinearly produce additional inelastic slip ΔS on the sliding fault. The ratio of this slip to the elastic displacement (ΔS/ΔSE), where ΔSE is the elastic displacement, depends on the slip‐reflection number, (∂V/∂τ)ρβ, where ∂V/∂τ is the derivative of sliding velocity with respect to shear traction, ρ is density, and β is S‐wave velocity. The sliding fault transmits and weakly reflects S waves for small values ≪2 of the parameter; it weakly transmits and strongly reflects for high values ≫2. It is relevant to evaluate ∂V/∂τ at the long‐period slip velocity V0 and shear traction τ0 of the gross earthquake. The ratio is then ΔS/ΔSE = ρβV0Φ/τ0, where Φ ≡ (∂V/∂τ)(τ0/V0) is measure of the nonlinearity the fault rheology. For example, the parameter Φ at high‐frequency impinging S waves is the ratio μ0/a of the coefficient of friction to the rate parameter a ≈ 0.01 for rate and state friction. Weak sliding faults (low τ0 and high V0) strongly reflect impinging S waves. During waning slip, dynamic stresses from S waves antithetical to the gross slip direction and compressional P waves may heterogeneously lock the fault.

The ratio of this slip to the elastic displacement (<span>Δ<i>S</i>/Δ<i>S</i> <sub> <i>E</i> </sub> </span>), where <span>Δ<i>S</i> <sub> <i>E</i> </sub> </span> is the elastic displacement, depends on the slip‐reflection number, <span>(<i>∂V</i>/<i>∂τ</i>)<i>ρβ</i> </span>, where <span> <i>∂V</i>/<i>∂τ</i> </span> is the derivative of sliding velocity with respect to shear traction, <span> <i>ρ</i> </span> is density, and <span> <i>β</i> </span> is <i>S</i>‐wave velocity. The sliding fault transmits and weakly reflects <i>S</i> waves for small values ≪2 of the parameter; it weakly transmits and strongly reflects for high values ≫2. It is relevant to evaluate <span> <i>∂V</i>/<i>∂τ</i> </span> at the long‐period slip velocity <span> <i>V</i> <sub>0</sub> </span> and shear traction <span> <i>τ</i> <sub>0</sub> </span> of the gross earthquake. The ratio is then <span>Δ<i>S</i>/Δ<i>S</i> <sub> <i>E</i> </sub> = <i>ρβV</i> <sub>0</sub>Φ/<i>τ</i> <sub>0</sub> </span>, where <span>Φ ≡ (<i>∂V</i>/<i>∂τ</i>)(<i>τ</i> <sub>0</sub>/<i>V</i> <sub>0</sub>)</span> is measure of the nonlinearity the fault rheology. For example, the parameter <span>Φ</span> at high‐frequency impinging <i>S</i> waves is the ratio <span> <i>μ</i> <sub>0</sub>/<i>a</i> </span> of the coefficient of friction to the rate parameter <span> <i>a</i> ≈ 0.01</span> for rate and state friction. Weak sliding faults (low <span> <i>τ</i> <sub>0</sub> </span> and high <span> <i>V</i> <sub>0</sub> </span>) strongly reflect impinging <i>S</i> waves. During waning slip, dynamic stresses from <i>S</i> waves antithetical to the gross slip direction and compressional <i>P</i> waves may heterogeneously lock the fault.</p>

Seismic Velocity Structure of the Magnetic Quiet Zone and Continent‐Ocean Boundary in the Northeastern South China Sea
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract In 2016, we carried out a coincidental multichannel reflection seismic and wide‐angle reflection/refraction seismic experiment along a 320‐km‐long profile across the northeastern margin of the South China Sea. Based on these new data, we studied velocity structure of the transitional continental crust using both forward modeling and travel‐time tomography. The velocity model shows that Mesozoic sediments have velocities of 4.3–5.3 km/s and are about 3–6 km thick in the magnetically quiet Chaoshan Depression and the attenuated transitional continental crust. Using forward magnetic modeling, we confirm that the presence of this thick Mesozoic layer with low magnetic susceptibility induces the magnetic quiet zone and show that the lower crust high‐velocity materials have limited effect on magnetic anomalies. This Mesozoic layer pinches out seaward near the continent‐ocean boundary (COB). Two apparently isolated high‐velocity anomalies are revealed in the lower crust of the continental slope. The first has velocities of 7.0–7.5 km/s and a maximum thickness of 8 km, and the second has velocities of 7.0–7.3 km/s and a maximum thickness of 3 km. We find that the discontinuity of the high‐velocity zones is not due to the lack of some seismic phases or lose of a seismometer. We suggest that postspreading magmatism caused these high‐velocity zones. A third high‐velocity zone, showing a distinctly large velocity gradient, is revealed near the COB. This indicates upper mantle upwelling and/or exhumation right at the COB, despite recent unsuccess in directly sampling these deep materials in the South China Sea.

A Joint Analysis of GPS Displacement and GRACE Geopotential Data for Simultaneous Estimation of Geocenter Motion and Gravitational Field
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Gravitational potential data from GRACE are being used to study mass redistribution within and between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and solid Earth. The GRACE data are made available in a reference frame with its origin at the center of mass of the Earth system (geocenter) while many other geophysical models and data sets refer to a reference frame attached to the Earth's surface. Changes in the offset between these reference frames (geocenter motion) must be accounted for when GRACE data are used to quantify surface mass changes. In this study, we developed a technique for co‐estimation of geocenter motion and gravitational potential field seamlessly from degree 1 to 90 by simultaneously inverting a set of globally‐distributed GPS displacement time series and the temporally‐varying GRACE gravity data. We found that the effect of geocenter motion was evident particularly in the GPS time series of horizontal displacements. Our estimates of geocenter motion are most consistent with the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) results within 1 mm in X and Z components and a submillimeter in Y component, when compared to monthly variability averaged over the period of 2003–2016. The overall magnitude of the degree‐1 (l = 1) surface mass load is estimated to be ~3 cm in equivalent water height annually migrating south‐westward from Europe (December–January) to the South Pacific (June–July). Our results also show that dense GPS network data improve water storage recovery in major river basins in the United States and Europe by contributing significantly to the recovery of higher‐degree (l ≥ ~20) geopotential coefficients.

Modeling Frequency‐Independent Q Viscoacoustic Wave Propagation in Heterogeneous Media
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Quantifying the attenuation of seismic waves propagating in the Earth interior is critical to study the subsurface structure. Previous studies have proposed fractional anelastic wave equations to model the frequency‐independent Q seismic wave propagation. Such wave equations involve fractional derivatives that pose computational challenges for the numerical schemes in terms of accuracy and efficiency when dealing with heterogeneous Earth media. To tackle these challenges, here we derive a new viscoacoustic wave equation, where the power terms of the fractional Laplacian operators are spatially independent, thus accurate and efficient methods (e.g., the Fourier pseudospectral method) can be adopted. Our derivation enables the resultant equation to capture both amplitude and phase signatures of the anelastic wave propagation by matching the complex wave numbers for all the frequencies of interest. We verify the derivation by comparing the dispersion curves of both the attenuation factor and the phase velocity produced by the new wave equation with their theoretical values as well as the Pierre Shale in situ measurements. Following that, we use a synthetic attenuating gas chimney model to demonstrate the attenuation effects on seismic waveforms and then construct the Q‐compensated reverse time migration to undo these effects for seismic image enhancement. Finally, we find that our forward modeling results can characterize the spatiotemporal attenuation effects revealed in the Frio‐II CO2 injection time‐lapse seismic monitoring data. We expect this proposed equation to be useful to quantify the attenuation in seismic data to push the resolution limits of seismic imaging and inversion.

Virtual Sources and Receivers in the Real Earth: Considerations for Practical Applications
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract To enhance monitoring of the subsurface, virtual sources and receivers inside the subsurface can be created from seismic reflection data at the surface of the Earth using the Marchenko method. The response between these virtual sources and receivers can be obtained through the use of homogeneous Green's function retrieval. A homogeneous Green's function is a superposition of a Green's function and its time reversal. The main aim of this paper is to obtain accurate homogeneous Green's functions from field data. Classical homogeneous Green's function retrieval requires an unrealistic enclosing recording surface; however, by using a recently proposed single‐sided retrieval scheme, this requirement can be avoided. We first demonstrate the principles of using the single‐sided representation on synthetic data and show that different source signatures can be taken into account. Because the Marchenko method is sensitive to recording limitations of the reflection data, we study five cases of recording limitations with synthetic data and demonstrate their effects on the final result. Finally, the method is demonstrated on a preprocessed field data set that fulfills the requirements for applying the single‐sided Green's function retrieval scheme. The scheme has the potential to be used in future applications, such as source localization.

Finite Strain Analysis of Shear and Compressional Wave Velocities
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Published shear‐modulus measurements for a wide variety of materials (Ar, Xe, H2, He, NaCl, H2O‐VII, MgO, stishovite, bridgmanite) show that the Eulerian (spatial) description of energy vs. strain fits both finite‐ and infinitesimal‐strain (e.g., wave velocity) elasticity data under high pressure. The Eulerian (spatial) formulations do so better than the Lagrangian (material) finite‐strain description, with differences of 1% to 60% in both P‐ and S‐wave velocities for these materials at the pressures of Earth's mantle. The results are significant in extending to shear previous findings that compressional (pressure‐volume and bulk‐modulus) measurements are also best fit using the spatial formulation. Our analysis empirically documents that a self‐consistent Eulerian finite‐strain equation of state offers a reliable means of describing the thermodynamic and elastic properties of planetary interiors.

Investigating the Accuracy of One‐Dimensional Volcanic Plume Models using Laboratory Experiments and Field Data
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract During volcanic eruptions, model predictions of plume height are limited by the accuracy of entrainment coefficients used in many plume models. Typically, two parameters are used, α and β, which relate the entrained air speed to the jet speed in the axial and cross‐flow directions, respectively. To improve estimates of these parameters, wind tunnel experiments have been conducted for a range of cross‐wind velocities and turbulence conditions. Measurements are compared directly to computations from the 1‐D plume model, Plumeria, in the near‐field, bending region of the jet. Entrainment coefficients are determined through regression analysis, demonstrating optimal combinations of effective α and β values. For turbulent conditions, all wind speeds overlapped at a single combination, α = 0.06 and β=0.46, each of which are slightly reduced from standard values. Refined coefficients were used to model plume heights for 20 historical eruptions. Model accuracy improves modestly in most cases, agreeing to within 3 km with observed plume heights. For weak eruptions, uncertainty in field measurements can outweigh the effects of these refinements, illustrating the challenge of applying plume models in practice.

Estimation of Capillary Pressure in Unconventional Reservoirs Using Thermodynamic Analysis of Pore Images
</title>

Abstract Unconventional reservoirs comprise a growing portion of producible reserves due to increasing knowledge of their nature as well as significant advances in production technology. The development of advanced pore‐scale modeling techniques presents potential for better estimation of reservoir flow characteristics including relative permeability, saturation distributions, and capillary pressure. Although pore‐scale network models take into account the pore throat connections and the appropriate fluid properties, highly simplified pore cross‐sectional shapes are still employed when estimating the threshold capillary pressure for fluid‐fluid displacements in each pore element. As a result, there is a growing need for more realistic threshold capillary pressure estimates generated using pore geometries that honor the real pore topology. To this end, a semianalytical model is presented that allows the prediction of threshold capillary pressure as well as the capillary pressure versus saturation relationship for piston‐like fluid displacements using images of unconventional reservoir rock samples. The model was validated on three different idealized pore geometries and compared against available analytical solutions, resulting in an error of less than 1% for all cases. The model was compared to experimental data using fluid occupancy maps obtained using an X‐ray nano‐CT scanner during an oil imbibition sequence into a miniature reservoir shale sample. The capillary pressure versus wetting phase saturation relationship was also determined for a 2‐D focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy image slice. The presented model shows promise for enabling more advanced pore‐scale modeling of shale rock.

<title>The Permeability of Columnar Jointed Lava</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Columnar jointed lava is an important facies in many geothermal reservoir systems. The permeability of jointed lavas is dominated by the contribution from fracture networks. We use a scaling for the permeability of a set of fractures in a solid or porous mass and extend this to arrays of hexagonal intercolumn fractures. To validate our analytical results, we create numerical domains with relevant geometries and extract system‐scale permeability using the LBflow lattice‐Boltzmann fluid flow simulation tool. Finally, we model the cooling contraction of columns to extend our results so that they predict the permeability with time after lava emplacement. Importantly, we use these results to estimate the range of permeabilities typical of columnar joints that form during cooling from high temperature and are preserved in the crust at moderate to low temperatures.

Direct and Microseismic Observations of Hydraulic Fracturing in Barre Granite and Opalinus Clayshale
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract While hydraulic fracturing is a well‐established and widely implemented process, there are still some aspects that can be better understood. Specifically, researchers do not fully understand the relation between the hydraulic fracture network and the microseismic events induced during hydraulic stimulation. In this laboratory study, we address this knowledge gap by conducting hydraulic fracturing experiments where we directly observe microstructural changes using a high‐speed camera attached to a 5X magnification lens and analyze the images using a digital image correlation code. These data are compared to simultaneously acquired acoustic emissions, from which we infer the location and focal mechanisms of induced microseismic events. Experiments were conducted on Opalinus clayshale and Barre granite, at injection rates of 0.019 and 0.39 ml/s for each rock. The simultaneous recording of microseismic and visual observations is unique and provides significant insight into the details of hydraulic fracturing. Our results show several interesting differences between granite and shale, and between injection rates. For example, we find that while the creation of hydraulic fractures is generally considered as tensile at the field scale, evidence of shearing can be observed to varying degrees at the microstructural scale. Specifically, we see that microstructural shearing is more evident in granite in the form of distinct en echelon microcracks. On the effect of the injection rate, we find that a reduced injection rate tends to create a more complex network of microcracks, along with a lower proportion of double‐couple (shear) focal mechanisms in the microseismic data.

Fault Reactivation During Fluid Pressure Oscillations: Transition From Stable to Unstable Slip
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract High‐pressure fluid injection in deep georeservoirs can induce earthquakes. Recent observations suggest that cyclic injections might trigger less seismicity than monotonic injections. Here, we report triaxial laboratory experiments conducted on faulted quartz‐rich sandstone that provide new insight into the physics of fault‐fluid interactions subjected to cyclic fluid pressure variations. The experiments were performed at 30 and 45 MPa confining pressure, imposing constant or sinusoidal fluid pressure oscillations of amplitudes ranging from 0 to 8 MPa in addition to a far‐field constant loading rate (10−4 and 10−3 mm s−1). The results show that (i) in agreement with the Mohr‐Coulomb theory, faults reactivate at the static friction criterion, which is generally reached at the maximum fluid pressure during oscillations. (ii) Oscillating fluid pressure perturbations promote seismic behavior rather than aseismic slip, and (iii) increasing the oscillation's amplitude enhances the onset of seismic activity along the fault. We demonstrate that this behavior is caused by slip rate variations resulting from the fluid pressure oscillations. Without fluid pressure oscillations, increasing the far‐field loading rate also promotes seismic activity. Our experiments demonstrate that the seismicity intensification due to cyclic fluid injections could be promoted at shallow depth, where confining pressure is relatively low, resulting in large strain rate perturbations.

Grain Fragmentation and Frictional Melting During Initial Experimental Deformation and Implications for Seismic Slip at Shallow Depths
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract During seismic slip, the elastic strain energy released by the wall rocks drives grain fragmentation and flash heating in the slipping zone, resulting in formation of (nano)powders and melt droplets, which lower the fault resistance. With progressive seismic slip, the frictional melt covers the slip surface and behaves as a lubricant reducing the coseismic fault strength. However, the processes associated to the transition from grain fragmentation to bulk frictional melting remain poorly understood. Here we discuss in situ microanalytical investigations performed on experimentally produced solidified frictional melts from the transition regime between grain fragmentation and frictional melting. The experiments were performed on granitic gneiss at seismic slip rates (1.3 and 5 m/s), normal stresses ranging from 3 to 30 MPa. At normal stresses <12 MPa, the apparent friction coefficient μapp (shear stress versus normal stress) evolves in a complex manner with slip: μapp decreases because of flash weakening, increases up to a peak value μp1 ~0.6–1.0, slightly decreases and increases again to a second peak value μp2 ~0.44–0.83, and eventually decreases with displacement to a steady‐state value μss ~0.3–0.45. In situ synchrotron observations of the solidified frictional melt show abundance of ultrafine quartz grains before μp2 and enrichment in SiO2 at μp2. Because partial melting occurs on the ultrafine quartz grains and, as a consequence, it suggested that the second re‐strengthening (μp2) is induced by the higher viscosity of the melt due to its enrichment in Si from melting of the ultrafine quartz grains derived from grain fragmentation.

Lithospheric Structure Beneath the Cretaceous Chilwa Alkaline Province (CAP) in Southern Malawi and Northeastern Mozambique
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We used aeromagnetic and satellite gravity data to investigate lithospheric structure beneath the Cretaceous Chilwa Alkaline Province (CAP) in southern Malawi and adjacent Mozambique. The CAP consists of granites, syenites, nepheline syenites, basanites, phonolite dikes, and minor carbonatite bodies. The intrusions were emplaced in the Precambrian (Mesoproterozoic‐Neoproterozoic) terranes of the Southern Irumide and Mozambique orogenic belts. Aeromagnetic data show the CAP as overlapping circular anomalies typical of nested igneous ring complexes formed through caldera collapse mechanism. We used gravity data to infer that: (1) the CAP was sourced from ~30‐km wide igneous bodies now preserved in the upper crust at ~5‐km depth. (2) the CAP is underlain by up to ~45‐km thick crust (due to mafic magmatic underplating) and a lithosphere as thin as ~90 km. These data suggest that mafic magmatic underplating and lithospheric thinning occurred during a Cretaceous rifting event. We propose, based on these results and taking into account previous petrographic, geochemical, geochronological, and isotopic studies, that the silica undersaturated magmatic phase of the CAP was due to flux melting of the asthenosphere. This was followed by silica‐rich magmatic phase due to decompression melting of the asthenosphere as a result of lithospheric thinning. Lithospheric thinning and ascendance of the asthenospheric melt might have been facilitated by the presence of late Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian suture zone. The heat provided by the mafic magmatic underplating resulted in partial melting of the lower crust to form the silica‐saturated CAP intrusions from mixed magma sources.

Recognition of Mesoscale Strike‐Slip En Echelon Faults From 2‐D Nonporous Models
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Growth and connection of preexisting fractures have been recognized as the driving mechanism of rock fracturing. This paper aims at throwing light on the geological implications of the fracturing behavior in pre‐cracked rock observed in rock mechanics‐oriented experiments, by numerical interpretation on the interaction of en echelon fractures. To properly simulate grain crushing involved in cataclastic deformation of nonporous rocks, a sophisticated numerical scheme incorporating rock morphology and crystallography into the grain‐based model is proposed. In line with a previous experimental study, seven grain‐based models with different configurations of en echelon flaws are numerically tested under uniaxial compression. The key results are (1) evaluation of the influences of preexisting flaws on mechanical properties and damage degree of the host rock, (2) visualization of the microfracture process zone into visible cracks, and (3) generalization of three different patterns of major fracture formation from en echelon fractures, during which the ratio of the number of intergranular to intragranular microcracks is used for evaluation of the cataclastic deformation process and the stress level. Based on the numerical results, we provide valuable interpretation on (1) the field occurrence of strike‐slip fault system with typical fracturing features, focusing on the effects of the sense of left or right stepping and the degrees of separation/overlap of the master fractures, and (2) three different mechanisms of fault formation from preexisting fractures. As an initial attempt to relate rock fracturing observed in laboratory experiments with the field occurrence, capabilities and limitations of this study are also presented.

Numerical Analysis of Time‐Dependent Conduit Magma Flow in Dome‐Forming Eruptions With Application to Mount St. Helens 2004–2008
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Conduit models of volcanic eruptions simulate magma evolution through phase transitions and material changes during ascent. We present a time‐dependent one‐dimensional model of a chamber‐conduit system to examine the temporal evolution of dome‐forming eruptions. As magma ascends, volatiles exsolve and may escape vertically through the column or laterally through the conduit walls. Magma solidifies which increases viscosity, leading to a natural transition from viscous flow at depth to frictional sliding along the conduit walls near the surface, resulting in the extrusion of a semisolid plug. The model evaluates time‐ and depth‐dependent pressure, velocity, porosity, and relative amounts of exsolved water to carbon dioxide. Transient effects arise when magma outflux from the chamber appreciably decreases pressure over the magma ascent timescale. For low magma permeability, transient effects increase porosity and velocity relative to steady‐state solutions. For high magma permeability, efficient vertical and lateral gas escape depresses porosity and velocity at later times. We use the model to predict three time series data sets from the 2004–2008 eruption of Mount St. Helens: extruded volume, ground deformation, and carbon dioxide emissions. We quantify sensitivity of model predictions to input parameters using the distance‐based generalized sensitivity analysis. Chamber volatile content, volume, and excess pressure influence the amplitude of observables, while conduit radius, frictional rate dependence and magma permeability influence temporal evolution. High magma permeability can cause marked departures from exponentially decaying flux and may explain the unique temporal evolution of deformation observed at the only nearby continuous GPS station in operation at the eruption onset.

Dielectric Polarization Studies in Partially Saturated Shale Cores
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Dielectric measurements of reservoir rocks are used to estimate important petro‐physical properties such as water‐filled porosity and pore surface textures. However, complex dielectric polarization processes that occur in rocks are strongly dependent on frequency, making physically meaningful interpretation of broadband dielectric data difficult. At high frequency (> 10 MHz) dielectric permittivity primarily relates to the volume fractions of constituents (i.e., saturation, minerals), while at lower frequency (< 10 MHz), interpretation is complicated by interfacial polarization, electro‐diffusion phenomena, and ohmic conduction. The ability to de‐convolve these electrical processes is critical for interpreting petro‐physical properties from broadband dielectric data. Here we demonstrate the application of Tikhonov regularization methods to compute dielectric relaxation time distributions from broadband (40 Hz to 110 MHz) dielectric data for ten shale core samples at varying partial saturation. Furthermore, via the Kramers‐Kronig relation, the contribution from in‐phase conduction currents to the imaginary component of the dielectric response was quantified. The evolution of dielectric polarization processes with increasing moisture content was analyzed directly from changes in relaxation time distributions. It was found that the dominant polarization mechanism, up to a critical partial saturation, occurred as surface polarization within the electrical double layer. Above this critical partial saturation, electro‐diffusion mechanisms acting between the Stern and diffuse layers resulted in a large low frequency response. This work provides valuable insight into dielectric polarization mechanisms in shales and demonstrates such measurements are sensitive to electrical double layer properties and electro‐diffusion length scales that are potentially relevant to characterizing pore‐scale properties in shales.

Quantification of 3‐D Thermal Anomalies From Surface Observations of an Orogenic Geothermal System (Grimsel Pass, Swiss Alps)
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Geothermal systems in amagmatic orogens involve topography‐driven infiltration of meteoric water up to 10 km deep into regional‐scale faults and exfiltration of the heated water in surface springs. The thermal anomalies along the upflow zones have not been quantified, yet they are key to estimating the geothermal exploitation potential of such systems. Here we quantify the three‐dimensional heat anomaly below the orogenic geothermal system at Grimsel Pass, Swiss Alps, where warm springs emanate from an exhumed, fossil hydrothermal zone. We use discharge rates and temperatures of the springs, temperature measurements along a shallow tunnel, and the formation temperature and depth of the fossil system to constrain coupled thermal–hydraulic numerical simulations of the upflow zone. The simulations reveal that upflow rates act as a first‐order control on the temperature distribution and that the site is underlain by an ellipsoidal thermal plume enclosing 102–103 PJ of anomalous heat per km depth. When the fossil system was active (3.3 Ma), the thermal plume was double its present size, corresponding to a theoretical petrothermal power output of 30–220 MW, with the 120 °C threshold for geothermal electricity production situated at less than 2‐km depth. We conclude that mountainous orogenic belts without igneous activity and even with only low background geothermal gradients typical of waning orogens are surprisingly promising plays for petrothermal power production. Our study implies exploration should focus on major valley floors because there the hydraulic head gradients and thus upflow rates and heat anomalies reach maximum values.

Dynamics, Radiation, and Overall Energy Budget of Earthquake Rupture With Coseismic Off‐Fault Damage
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Earthquake ruptures dynamically activate coseismic off‐fault damage around fault cores. Systematic field observation efforts have shown the distribution of off‐fault damage around main faults, while numerical modeling using elastic‐plastic off‐fault material models have demonstrated the evolution of coseismic off‐fault damage during earthquake ruptures. Laboratory‐scale microearthquake experiments have pointed out the enhanced high‐frequency radiation due to the coseismic off‐fault damage. However, the detailed off‐fault fracturing mechanisms, subsequent radiation, and its contribution to the overall energy budget remain to be fully understood because of limitations of current observational techniques and model formulations. Here, we constructed a new physics‐based dynamic earthquake rupture modeling framework, based on the combined finite‐discrete element method, to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of coseismic off‐fault damage, and its effect on the rupture dynamics, the radiation and the overall energy budget. We conducted a 2‐D systematic case study with depth and showed the mechanisms of dynamic activation of the coseismic off‐fault damage. We found the decrease in rupture velocity and the enhanced high‐frequency radiation in near field due to the coseismic off‐fault damage. We then evaluated the overall energy budget, which shows a significant contribution of the coseismic off‐fault damage to the overall energy budget even at depth, where the damage zone width becomes narrower. The present numerical framework for the dynamic earthquake rupture modeling thus provides new insights into earthquake rupture dynamics with the coseismic off‐fault damage.

Delayed Weakening and Reactivation of Rate‐and‐State Faults Driven by Pressure Changes Due to Fluid Injection
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Fault reactivation induced by pore pressure changes involves complex frictional phenomena because effective normal stresses vary in space and time due to fluid flow and rock deformation. The impact of time‐varying normal stresses on fault friction has been characterized in stress‐step laboratory experiments and modeled through extended rate‐and‐state laws that incorporate a stressing‐rate dependence of the state variable. Building on these rate‐and‐state models, we use 2‐D poroelastic simulations to understand how the evolution of pore pressures due to fluid injection affects fault strength and reactivation. A sharp increase in pore pressure, associated with fluid injection, leads to an increase in friction coefficient and to a delayed weakening of the fault. Conversely, a sharp pressure decrease during extraction leads to a delayed strengthening. Stressing‐rate effects emerge as a purely frictional mechanism that delays or accelerates the onset of fault slip, suggesting that reactivation under fluid injection may occur long after flow rates have decreased and pore pressures have stabilized at the fault. Hence, earthquakes induced by injection may ensue as a deferred process triggered several days later than predicted by simple estimates based on constant friction. The duration of the delay depends on the type of rate‐and‐state law used in calculations and on a characteristic relaxation time: The memory time over which the state variable evolves under stationary contact. Our results help understand the connection between injection protocols and frictional weakening mechanisms, suggesting that injection processes can be engineered to minimize the risk of induced seismicity for a given injected volume.

Curie Depth, Heat Flux, and Thermal Subsidence Reveal the Pacific Mantle Outflow Through the Scotia Sea
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The sinking of the ocean sea bottom is produced by thermal cooling of the lithosphere. This evolution is determined by the underlying asthenospheric mantle. Estimation of the Curie Depth variations in the Scotia Sea by using a spectral approach and applied on magnetic anomaly data led us to determine a thermal model and derive a heat flux map. Using multichannel seismic and bathymetry data, we show that the West Scotia Sea reaches thermal equilibrium more quickly than other oceans do and thermally behaves like old oceanic crust in large oceans, following a different empirical age (t, in Ma)‐depth (d, in m) relationship, d(t) = 4,480 − 19,380 exp(−t/4). For oceanic crusts of the same age, underlain by different shallow mantle controlling the heat supply, low heat flux values imply older ages than those predicted for large oceans based on the empirical relationships of the standard plate model. These circumstances, together with the new heat flux map, shed light on the anomalous evolution of the Scotia Sea, a consequence of the present Pacific mantle outflow through the Drake Passage. Two branches of elevated heat flux surround the Shackleton Fracture Zone and extend to the northern and southern boundaries of the Scotia Plate. Most of the heat sources are located in the flanks, whereas the colder parts are centrally located. This signature supports the Drake Passage's role as a main mantle gateway for Pacific outflow toward the Atlantic reservoir favoring the oceanic spreading activity of this ocean.

Using Machine Learning to Automatically Detect Volcanic Unrest in a Time Series of Interferograms
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The latest generation of synthetic aperture radar satellites produce measurements of ground deformation at the majority of the world's subaerial active volcanoes and can be used to detect signs of volcanic unrest. We present an automatic detection algorithm that uses these data to automatically warn when deformation at a volcano departs from the background. We demonstrate our approach on synthetic data sets and the unrest leading to the 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra (Galapagos). Our algorithm encompasses spatial independent component analysis and uses a significantly improved version of the ICASO algorithm, which we term ICASAR, to robustly perform spatial independent component analysis.

<h2>Abstract</h2> <p>The latest generation of synthetic aperture radar satellites produce measurements of ground deformation at the majority of the world's subaerial active volcanoes and can be used to detect signs of volcanic unrest. We present an automatic detection algorithm that uses these data to automatically warn when deformation at a volcano departs from the background. We demonstrate our approach on synthetic data sets and the unrest leading to the 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra (Galapagos). Our algorithm encompasses spatial independent component analysis and uses a significantly improved version of the ICASO algorithm, which we term ICASAR, to robustly perform spatial independent component analysis. We use ICASAR to isolate signals of geophysical interest from atmospheric signals, before monitoring the evolution of these signals through time in order to detect the onset of a period of volcanic unrest.</p>

Transient Deformation in California From Two Decades of GPS Displacements: Implications for a Three‐Dimensional Kinematic Reference Frame
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Our understanding of plate boundary deformation has been enhanced by transient signals observed against the backdrop of time‐independent secular motions. We make use of a new analysis of displacement time series from about 1,000 continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) stations in California from 1999 to 2018 to distinguish tectonic and nontectonic transients from secular motion. A primary objective is to define a high‐resolution three‐dimensional reference frame (datum) for California that can be rapidly maintained with geodetic data to accommodate both secular and time‐dependent motions. To this end, we compare the displacements to those predicted by a horizontal secular fault slip model for the region and construct displacement and strain rate fields. Over the past 19 years, California has experienced 19 geodetically detectable earthquakes and widespread postseismic deformation. We observe postseismic strain rate variations as large as 1,000 nstrain/year with moment releases equivalent up to an Mw6.8 earthquake. We find significant secular differences up to 10 mm/year with the fault slip model, from the Mendocino Triple Junction to the southern Cascadia subduction zone, the northern Basin and Range, and the Santa Barbara channel. Secular vertical uplift is observed across the Transverse Ranges, Coastal Ranges, Sierra Nevada, as well as large‐scale postseismic uplift after the 1999 Mw7.1 Hector Mine and 2010 Mw7.2 El Mayor‐Cucapah earthquakes. We also identify areas of vertical land motions due to anthropogenic, natural, and magmatic processes. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the kinematic datum by improving the accuracy of high‐spatial‐resolution 12‐day repeat‐cycle Sentinel‐1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar displacement and velocity maps.

Coseismic Slip and Early Afterslip of the M6.0 24 August 2014 South Napa, California, Earthquake
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We employ strong motion seismograms and static offsets from the Global Positioning System, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, and other measurements in order to derive a coseismic slip and afterslip model of the M6.0 24 August 2014 South Napa earthquake. This earthquake ruptured an ∼13‐km‐long portion of the West Napa fault with predominantly right‐lateral strike slip. In the kinematic seismic slip inversions, we couple the coseismic slip and afterslip distributions by requiring both distributions to involve right‐lateral strike slip with positive amplitude, with the net static slip being the sum of the two. We consider several candidate fault geometries: a first involving two steeply east dipping fault planes that reach Earth's surface at the western surface trace (STW), where most surface rupture was observed, a second involving a steeply west dipping plane that also reaches Earth's surface at the STW, and a third involving a combination of two variably west dipping planes constrained to pass through the locus of postseismic seismicity located ∼1 km west of the STW. The data are best fit using the model of two east dipping fault planes, with coseismic slip up to ∼1.2 m on a dominant shallow asperity about 10 km north of the hypocenter and on deeper asperities on the southern part of the rupture. Afterslip up to 1 m is concentrated along the southern part of the rupture at depths 5 km, consistent with surface observations of afterslip. Seismic moments associated with coseismic slip and afterslip are 1.13×1018 N m (Mw 6.00) and 3.64×1017 N m, respectively.

Systematic Detection of Clustered Seismicity Beneath the Southwestern Alps
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We present a new automated earthquake detection and location method based on beamforming (or back projection) and template matching and apply it to study the seismicity of the Southwestern Alps. We use beamforming with prior knowledge of the 3‐D variations of seismic velocities as a first detection run to search for earthquakes that are used as templates in a subsequent matched‐filter search. Template matching allows us to detect low signal‐to‐noise ratio events and thus to obtain a high spatiotemporal resolution of the seismicity in the Southwestern Alps. We describe how we address the problem of false positives in energy‐based earthquake detection with supervised machine learning and how to best leverage template matching to iteratively refine the templates and the detection. We detected 18,754 earthquakes over 1 year (our catalog is available online) and observed temporal clustering of the earthquake occurrence in several regions. This statistical study of the collective behavior of earthquakes provides insights into the mechanisms of earthquake occurrence. Based on our observations, we infer the mechanisms responsible for the seismic activity in three regions of interest: the Ubaye valley, the Briançonnais, and the Dora Maira massif. Our conclusions point to the importance of fault interactions to explain the earthquake occurrence in the Briançonnais and the Dora Maira massif, whereas fluids seem to be the major driving mechanism in the Ubaye valley.

Hf and Nd Isotopic Constraints on Pre‐ and Syn‐collisional Crustal Thickness of Southern Tibet
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract In Southern Tibet, voluminous granitoids emplaced between 225‐20 Ma provide a spatiotemporal window into the geochemical and tectonic evolution of the crust. Hf and O isotope geochemistry of whole rocks and constituent zircons together with whole‐rock chemistry reveal a coherent magmatic history of Gangdese granitoids, and by extension, crustal thickening history of S. Tibet. We observe a spatial isotopic gradient with N‐S distance from the Indus‐Tsangpo Suture (ITS), with younger, more εHf‐positive granitoids adjacent the ITS. Zircons range from εHf = ‐13 to +11 in a broadly systematic fashion from north to south, generally independent of 206Pb/238U age. Adjacent to the ITS, syncollisional (<50 Ma) rocks have generally more heterogeneous εHf than precollisional (>70 Ma) and early syncollisional (50‐70 Ma) granitoids, likely reflecting increased assimilation of crustal material in syncollisional magmas as the crust thickened. Zircon δ18O ranges between +4 and +8‰; syncollisional samples have exclusively mantle‐like values (+5.5 to +6‰), with greater heterogeneity in precollisional samples. Zircon and whole‐rock εHf data reported here are consistent with previous Nd‐based thermoisotopic models indicating that the Lhasa block maintained a wedge‐shaped crustal geometry from the early Jurassic until the onset of collision. Given evidence of minimal post‐50 Ma upper‐crustal shortening, these results support earlier findings that the Tibetan crust reached its present ~75 km thickness via a roughly equal mixture of upper plate accretion and juvenile magmatic inflation on top of the ~30 km‐thick of Indian crust underthrust beneath the Lhasa block.

Orogenic Root Delamination Induced by Eclogitization of Thickened Lower Crust in the Chinese Western Tianshan: Constraints From Adakites
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Crustal delamination induced by eclogitization of orogenic roots, in addition to plate subduction, is an important process that transfers crustal materials back into the mantle. Many previous studies have demonstrated a causal link between crustal delamination and eclogitization, but actual magmatic records of the process are rarely documented. Here we present detailed studies on two distinct late Paleozoic adakite suites in the Awulale Mountains (Chinese Western Tianshan), that is, the suites with high (HN) and low (LN) Nb/Ta ratios, to constrain the regional crustal delamination. Both igneous suites have adakitic affinity and formed by partial melting of the juvenile thickened lower crust with different residual mineral assemblages in their source regions. The late Carboniferous HN adakite has superchondritic Nb/Ta (21.4–23.3) and high Dy/Yb (2.66–2.88) ratios and may have formed via rutile‐bearing, eclogite‐controlled melting of the lower crust, implying crustal thickening and eclogitization. In contrast, the Permian LN adakites have varying and lower ranges of Nb/Ta (12.9–20.0) and Dy/Yb ratios (1.35–2.53), which were probably derived from mixing of garnet‐bearing amphibolite with minor rutile‐bearing, eclogite‐controlled melts, implying crustal thinning and the end of eclogitization. The succession of these two adakite suites suggests that during the late Carboniferous to early Permian, eclogitization of the orogenic root, accompanying successive crustal delaminations, occurred in this region. Accordingly, our results imply that adakites with different geochemical features are potential tracers for the mineralogy of orogenic roots and, importantly, provide convincing evidence for eclogitization‐induced crustal delamination in orogenic belts.

Improving Absolute Earthquake Location in West Texas Using Probabilistic, Proxy Ground‐Truth Station Corrections
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract An increase in induced seismicity in the central United States since 2009 led to establishment of TexNet seismic‐monitoring in Texas. Accurate, absolute seismic‐event location is critical to TexNet, allowing quantitative evaluation of possible association of seismicity with human activity. For the Delaware Basin, western Texas, relocation using different velocity models and TexNet station subsets shows absolute location error up to 4–5 km. The preferred method to reduce absolute error, ground‐truth calibration, is not available in this area. Alternatively, we used industrial well activity as proxy, ground‐truth for developing probabilistic, proxy ground‐truth (PPGT) station corrections for relocation. Assuming well activity causes seismicity, we defined a distance–time probability associating events and well activity. We used these associations and other evidence to show some seismicity in the Delaware Basin is more likely due to hydraulic‐fracturing than saltwater disposal. We then probabilistically accumulated PPGT station corrections using event hypocenters constrained to associated fracturing‐well locations. We applied this procedure within 12 km of TexNet station PB02, optimizing the procedure through comparison of rates of causal and acausal associations. Relative to the initial locations, final PPGT relocations show smaller residuals and shifts in epicenter as much as 3 km, predominantly toward the north and northwest. PPGT residuals are similar to those from relocation with standard station corrections. The initial hypocenters showed an unreasonable deepening with distance from station PB02, whereas PPGT relocations produced an overall flattening of event depths. These results are consistent with PPGT corrections giving real improvement in absolute location accuracy.

Alternatively, we used industrial well activity as proxy, ground‐truth for developing probabilistic, proxy ground‐truth (PPGT) station corrections for relocation. Assuming well activity causes seismicity, we defined a distance–time probability associating events and well activity. We used these associations and other evidence to show some seismicity in the Delaware Basin is more likely due to hydraulic‐fracturing than saltwater disposal. We then probabilistically accumulated PPGT station corrections using event hypocenters constrained to associated fracturing‐well locations. We applied this procedure within 12 km of TexNet station PB02, optimizing the procedure through comparison of rates of causal and acausal associations. Relative to the initial locations, final PPGT relocations show smaller residuals and shifts in epicenter as much as 3 km, predominantly toward the north and northwest. PPGT residuals are similar to those from relocation with standard station corrections. The initial hypocenters showed an unreasonable deepening with distance from station PB02, whereas PPGT relocations produced an overall flattening of event depths. These results are consistent with PPGT corrections giving real improvement in absolute location accuracy.</p>

CO2‐Saturated Brine Injection Into Unconsolidated Sandstone: Implications for Carbon Geosequestration
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Carbon dioxide (CO2) injection into deep depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs or saline aquifers is currently considered the best approach to large‐scale CO2 storage. Importantly, the pore structure and permeability of the storage rock are affected by fines release, migration, and reattachment in the initial stage of CO2 injection, especially in unconsolidated sandstone reservoirs. It is thus necessary to better understand the pore structure changes and the associated permeability evolution during and after CO2 injection. We thus imaged an unconsolidated sandstone at reservoir conditions before and after CO2‐saturated brine (“live brine”) injection in situ via X‐ray microcomputed tomography to explore the effects of fines migration and mineral dissolution induced by CO2 injection. We found that in the examined sample, large pores dominated the total porosity, and porosity slightly increased after live‐brine flooding. Moreover, and importantly, the pore structure changed significantly: large pores were further enlarged while small pores shrank or even disappeared. These structural changes in the tested sample were caused by mobilized fines due to the high‐fluid interstitial velocity, which eventually reattached to the grains further downstream. Furthermore, the impact of the pore structural changes on permeability were analyzed in detail numerically. These permeability results are consistent with a fines migration mechanism where reattached fines block pore throats and thus decrease permeability drastically. We therefore can conclude that live brine injected into the examined unconsolidated sandstone will slightly improve storage space (porosity slightly increased); however, injectivity may be severely impaired by the permeability reduction.

Logarithmic Model Joint Inversion Method for Coseismic and Postseismic Slip: Application to the 2017 Mw 7.3 Sarpol Zahāb Earthquake, Iran
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has become an important technique for studying earthquake cycle deformation. However, due to the limited satellite revisit time, it is often difficult to fully separate coseismic and postseismic slip from InSAR data. Nevertheless, accurately estimating spatiotemporal coseismic and postseismic fault slip distribution models is important for quantifying earthquake slip, understanding the kinematics of seismogenic faulting, and evaluating seismic hazards. Here, we develop a logarithmic model‐based method (LogSIM) for the joint inversion of coseismic and postseismic fault slip using InSAR data from multiple platforms in different orbits. This method considers the nature of early postseismic slip following logarithmic decay. The coseismic slip, the decay time constant, and the decay amplitude of the logarithmic model can be jointly estimated from unwrapped interferograms without the need for InSAR time series calculations, thereby reducing the number of unknown parameters and stabilizing the inversion. The robustness of LogSIM is first validated with synthetic experiments. We then apply LogSIM to invert for the coseismic and postseismic slip models of the 2017 Mw 7.3 Sarpol Zahāb earthquake. We find that the maximum afterslip value and postseismic moment release during the first four months reported in previous studies are underestimated by ~26% and ~31%, respectively, due to the unavailability of the first five days of postseismic deformation. The estimated afterslip distribution spatially overlaps with the aftershocks in the updip region of the fault plane. LogSIM could potentially be extended to integrate different space geodetic data in earthquake cycle deformation modeling.

Water Availability and Deformation Processes in Smectite‐Rich Gouges During Seismic Slip
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Smectite clays occur in subduction zone fault cores at shallow depth (approximately 1 km; e.g., Japan Trench) and landslide décollements (e.g., Vajont, Italy, 1963). The availability of pore fluids affects the likelihood that seismic slip propagates from deeper to shallow fault depths or that a landslide accelerates to its final collapse. To investigate the deformation processes active during seismic faulting we performed friction experiments with a rotary machine on 2‐mm‐thick smectite‐rich gouge layers (70/30 wt % Ca‐montmorillonite/opal) sheared at 5‐MPa normal stress, at slip rates of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.3 m/s, and total displacement of 3 m. Experiments were performed on predried gouges under vacuum, under room humidity and under partly saturated conditions. The fault shear strength measured in the experiments was included in a one‐dimensional numerical model incorporating frictional heating, thermal, and thermochemical pressurization. Quantitative X‐ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy investigations were performed on pristine and deformed smectite‐rich gouges. Under dry conditions, cataclasis and amorphization dominated at slip rates of 0.001–0.1 m/s, whereas grain size sensitive flow and, under vacuum, frictional melting occurred at fast slip rates (1.3 m/s). Under partly saturated conditions, frictional slip in a smectite foliation occurred in combination with pressurization of water by shear‐enhanced compaction and, for V = 0.01–1.3 m/s, with thermal pressurization. Pseudotachylytes, the only reliable microstructural markers for seismic slip, formed only with large frictional power (>2 MW/m2), which could be achieved at shallow depth with high slip rates, or, at depth, with high shear stress in dehydrated smectites.

Subduction‐Induced Upwelling of a Hydrous Transition Zone: Implications for the Cenozoic Magmatism in Northeast China
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The widespread Cenozoic basalts in northeast China are commonly thought to be related to the stagnation of the Pacific slab in the transition zone and its deep dehydration. By incorporating experimentally constrained phase diagrams of hydrous mantle and melting conditions at high pressures into two‐dimensional petrological‐thermomechanical models, here we model the interaction of a subducting slab with a hydrous transition zone (TZ) and examine its potential role in generating intracontinental magmatism. The model results show that descending of the oceanic slab first forces up the material in the TZ. Depending on the water content in the TZ, the upwelling hydrous material may undergo dehydration melting above the TZ. As a large slab stagnates within the TZ owing to the lower mantle resistance, the deep melting migrates progressively toward the overriding continent's interior, generating plutonic/volcanic rocks in the continental crust far away from the trench. The amount of deep melting and surface magmatism is obviously related to the amount of water stored in the TZ. In contrast, the water stored in the cold core of the subducting slab and released in the transition zone does not generate melting as it is entirely absorbed by mantle transition zone nominally anhydrous minerals. Comparing the model results with the distribution of the late Cenozoic basalts in northeast China, we suggest that the intracontinental magmatism there was likely caused by deep dehydration melting induced by the slab‐transition zone interaction.

Seismicity and Velocity Structure of Lō'ihi Submarine Volcano and Southeastern Hawai'i
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Hundreds of earthquakes were recorded during a nine‐month ocean bottom seismometer deployment surrounding Lō'ihi submarine volcano, Hawai'i. The 12‐station ocean bottom seismometer network widened the aperture of earthquake detection around the Big Island, allowing better constraints on the location of seismicity offshore Hawai'i. Although this deployment occurred during a time of volcanic quiescence for Lō'ihi, it establishes an important basis for background seismicity of the volcano. Offshore seismicity during this study was dominated by events located in the mantle fault zone at depths of 25–40 km. These events reflect rupture on preexisting faults in the lower lithosphere caused by stresses induced by volcano loading and flexure of the Pacific Plate (Pritchard et al., 2007, https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365‐246X.2006.03169.x; Wolfe et al., 2004, https://doi.org/10.1029/2003GC000618). Tomography was performed using double‐difference seismic tomography and showed shallow velocities to be slower than the regional velocity model (HG50; Klein, 1981, https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article/71/5/1503/118231/A‐linear‐gradient‐crustal‐model‐for‐south‐Hawaii). A broad, low‐velocity anomaly was observed from 20–40‐km depth, and is suggestive of the central plume conduit that supplies magma to Lō'ihi and the active volcanoes of the Big Island. A localized high‐velocity body is observed 4–6‐km depth beneath Lō'ihi's summit, extending 10 km to the north and south. Following Lō'ihi's active rift zones and crossing the summit, this high‐velocity body is characteristic of intrusive material. Two low‐velocity anomalies are observed below the oceanic crust, interpreted as melt accumulation beneath Lō'ihi and magmatic underplating beneath Hawai'i Island.

The Formation of Forced Folds and Wing‐Like Sand Intrusions Driven by Pore Fluid Overpressure: Implications From 2‐D Experimental Modeling
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Sand injections form by intrusion of overpressured, fluidized sand into surrounding low‐permeable, fine‐grained rocks. Modern 3‐D seismic data revealed their abundant occurrence in many sedimentary basins and that their intrusion is typically associated with forced folding and tensile fractures of the sealing cover layer. In order to investigate the kinematic evolution of forced folds in relation to the associated propagation of fractures originating from an overpressured source layer, we performed idealized, quasi‐2‐D analog experiments. The models consist of noncohesive and cohesive granulates to mimic a sand reservoir and its overburden layer and injected air to produce fluid overpressure in the layered materials. Our results show that forced folding first induces tensile bending fractures at the base of the fold limbs at a certain critical fluid pressure. Due to further increase of the fluid pressure, the apex of these bending fractures serves as origin for branching, conical fractures characterized by shear and tensile failure. Fracture breakthrough is accompanied by a rapid uplift of the breached fold limb and a pressure drop in the reservoir layer followed by a continuous subsidence of the central forced fold. The morphology of the fracture pattern and the forced fold provides helpful implications for understanding formation processes of natural sand injections observed in seismic data and in outcrops.

<h2>Abstract</h2> <p>Sand injections form by intrusion of overpressured, fluidized sand into surrounding low‐permeable, fine‐grained rocks. Modern 3‐D seismic data revealed their abundant occurrence in many sedimentary basins and that their intrusion is typically associated with forced folding and tensile fractures of the sealing cover layer. In order to investigate the kinematic evolution of forced folds in relation to the associated propagation of fractures originating from an overpressured source layer, we performed idealized, quasi‐2‐D analog experiments. The models consist of noncohesive and cohesive granulates to mimic a sand reservoir and its overburden layer and injected air to produce fluid overpressure in the layered materials. Our results show that forced folding first induces tensile bending fractures at the base of the fold limbs at a certain critical fluid pressure. Due to further increase of the fluid pressure, the apex of these bending fractures serves as origin for branching, conical fractures characterized by shear and tensile failure. Fracture breakthrough is accompanied by a rapid uplift of the breached fold limb and a pressure drop in the reservoir layer followed by a continuous subsidence of the central forced fold. The morphology of the fracture pattern and the forced fold provides helpful implications for understanding formation processes of natural sand injections observed in seismic data and in outcrops.</p>

Open Apatite Sr Isotopic System in Low‐Temperature Hydrous Regimes
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Single crystal in situ Sr and Nd isotopic analysis of apatite permits more accurate interrogation of a variety of geoscience questions, including provenance, petrogenesis, and ore system evolution. However, the degree to which the apatite Sr and Nd isotopic systems remain closed under extended low‐temperature hydrous conditions is not well constrained. Granitoids at the Baogutu deposit in NW China contain veins of low‐temperature H2O‐rich epistilbite and thus provide an excellent opportunity to evaluate isotopic system integrity under low‐temperature hydrous conditions. Apatite from the Late Carboniferous diorite and granodiorite porphyry show variable (87Sr/86Sr)i ratios (0.7042 to 0.7062) but restricted εNd(t) values (+7.0±0.4 and +6.5±0.4, 1σ). The apatite Sr isotope signatures are transitional between whole rock (0.7035) and vein epistilbite (~0.7062), indicating apparent incorporation of radiogenic Sr from the epistilbite‐related hydrothermal fluid into the igneous apatite, whereas εNd values closely match those of the whole rock (+6.9±0.2 and +6.5±0.2, 1σ) and epistilbite (+6.2±0.2, 1σ). Obvious metasomatic textures of apatite were revealed by cathodoluminescence images. The 260 to 300°C formation temperatures for earlier quartz‐sulfide veins and chlorite alteration and homogenization temperature (~190°C) of fluid inclusions in epistilbite‐calcite vein calcite constrain the temperature of the later epistilbite‐related hydrothermal fluid to 190 to 260°C. These results indicate that Sr and likely Nd isotopes in apatite are mobile under low‐temperature (<300°C) hydrous conditions and implies that Rb‐Sr signatures in apatite from hydrothermally altered rocks reveal the presence and characteristics of modifying fluids.

What Drives the Continental Crust To Be Extremely Hot So Quickly?
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The widespread spatio‐temporal occurrence of ultrahigh‐temperature (UHT) metamorphism in continental crust has been widely documented, but the heat source responsible for generating these extreme conditions over a short period of time remains enigmatic. Here, garnet orthogneiss, spinel‐bearing granulite, and gabbronorite from the east Khondalite belt, China, have been analyzed via integrated geochemistry, U‐Pb zircon isotope geochronology, and phase equilibria modeling to shed light on the timing and nature of rapid UHT metamorphism in this area. Peak metamorphism is characterized in garnet orthogneiss by the assemblage garnet + orthopyroxene + plagioclase + K‐feldspar + quartz, which is calculated to represent pressure–temperature conditions of 0.83–0.88 GPa at 930–990 °C. Zircon ages from this sample yield an igneous (protolith) emplacement age of approximately 1.93–1.95 Ga, which matches the timing of metamorphism in adjacent (pre‐UHT) metapelites. These garnet orthogneiss were then metamorphosed to UHT conditions at approximately 1.92 Ga, coincident with emplacement of mantle‐derived gabbronorites, as supported by REE patterns in zircon, and evidence for a rapid thermal pulse in the east Khondalite belt lower crust at that time. Heat‐source and heat‐transfer calculations indicate that advected heat from mafic magmas is the most likely cause of this regional‐scale event, although ductile shearing might have contributed to a lesser degree.

Vertically Extensive Magma Reservoir Revealed From Joint Inversion and Quantitative Interpretation of Seismic and Gravity Data
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Recent advances in our understanding of arc magmatic systems indicate that melt is stored for long periods in low‐melt fraction crystal mushes and that eruptible magma reservoirs are short‐lived and are assembled rapidly by buoyancy‐induced instabilities and draining of the crystal mush. Many aspects of their architecture remain unclear, particularly in relation to their geometry and shallow melt distribution. We investigate the storage of melt below the active Soufrière Hills Volcano (SHV), Montserrat, using joint geophysical inversion combined with a quantitative interpretation approach based on rock physics. We jointly inverted active‐source P‐wave traveltimes and gravity anomalies to derive coincident 3‐D models of P‐wave velocity and density to a depth of 8 km. Comparative analysis of the active SHV and extinct Centre Hills volcano and effective elastic medium computations allow us to constrain temperature, melt fraction, and melt geometry. A continuous column of partial melt is inferred beneath SHV, at 4–8 km depth. Melt fraction is ~6% (ranging from 3 to 13% depending on melt geometry) and is maximum at 5–6 km depth. When under‐recovery of the low‐vP volume is taken into account, the melt fraction is revised to ~17% (ranging from 11 to 28%). Analysis of vP/density cross plots indicates that the melt distribution is best represented by low‐aspect ratio geometries. These likely span a multiscale spectrum ranging from grain‐scale inclusions and fractures to 100‐m‐scale dykes and sills. Our results confirm the concept of vertically extensive crystal mush including one or multiple more melt‐rich layers.

Precollisional Latitude of the Northern Tethyan Himalaya From the Paleocene Redbeds and Its Implication for Greater India and the India‐Asia collision
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The precollisional paleolatitude of the Tethyan Himalaya is essential to constrain the India‐Asia collision, the size of Greater India, and the Neotethyan paleogeography. However, reliable Late Cretaceous‐Paleocene paleomagnetic datasets are still scarce because of serious remagnetization. Here we report the first redbed‐based paleomagnetic results from the Paleocene (60‐58 Ma) redbeds in the Saga area of the northern Tethyan Himalaya. The tilt‐corrected site‐mean direction obtained from 36 paleomagnetic sites is D=178.7°, I=9.5° with ɑ95=5.4°, corresponding to a paleopole at 55.9°N, 267.6°E with dp/dm=2.8°/5.5° and a paleolatitude of 4.8°±2.8°S for the study area (29.3°N, 85.3°E). The site‐mean inclination increased from 9.5 to 14.9° after the anisotropy‐based inclination shallowing correction, leading to corresponding paleolatitudes increasing from 4.8 to 7.6°S. This reliable paleomagnetic dataset passes positive fold tests and supports that the northern Tethyan Himalaya was located at 6.3±4.3°S during 60‐58 Ma. Comparison with the coeval paleolatitudes expected from the Indian craton indicates that a north‐south crustal shortening of 3.1±5.5° (340±610 km) occurred between the Indian craton and the northern Tethyan Himalaya after 59 Ma, and no wide ocean extended between them after the Latest Jurassic. Our new Paleocene results together with reliable Cretaceous paleomagnetic results from the Lhasa terrane show that the India‐Asia collision occurred at 47.1±4.5 Ma.

Lower Crustal Heterogeneity Beneath the Northern Tibetan Plateau Constrained by GPS Measurements Following the 2001 Mw7.8 Kokoxili Earthquake
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We use GPS measurements across the Xidatan segment of the Kunlun fault in the Tibetan Plateau to investigate the surface deformation following the 2001 Mw 7.8 Kokoxili earthquake. We find significant postseismic deformation during the period 2007–2015, characterized by an asymmetric shear across the 2001 rupture, with average velocities reaching ~10 mm/year about 30–45 km south of the coseismic rupture. We also find that the postseismic transients diffused away from the coseismic rupture through time, with a shift of the maximum transient rates from ~20–30 km south of the rupture in 2001–2002 to ~30–45 km in 2007–2015. Viscoelastic relaxation is the dominant physical process during the period 2007–2015. The estimated effective viscosity of the lower crust beneath the Songpan‐Ganzi terrane is 2 × 1018–3 × 1018 Pa s from the 2001–2002 data, and it has increased to ~2 × 1019 Pa s for the period 6 to 14 years after the event. The large asymmetry in the postseismic deformation field indicates a laterally heterogeneous lower crust beneath the northern Tibetan Plateau. Viscoelastic relaxation models show that the viscosity of the lower crust beneath the Qaidam basin is ~2 and ~4 times larger than the viscosity of the lower crust beneath the Songpan‐Ganzi terrane in 2001–2002 and 2007–2015, respectively. Based on these data and results from previous studies, we postulate that the Kunlun fault itself is not the unique rheological boundary and that additional domains with viscosity increasing from the Qiangtang terrane to the Qaidam basin appear to be required.

A Recurrent Magmatic Pattern on Observable Timescales Prior to Plinian Eruptions From Nevado de Toluca (Mexico)
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Nevado de Toluca is a stratovolcano in the densely populated Mexican Highland and the source of three late Pleistocene Plinian eruptions. While the characterization of the magmatic processes and timescales, leading to these events, is crucial to evaluate potential signals of the reawakening of this volcano, they are not well constrained. Here we present insights gathered from the analysis of mineral zoning. Abrupt changes in plagioclase compositions (anorthite [An] >10 mol. %) record repeated thermochemical disturbance of a shallow magma reservoir prior to the three eruptions investigated. In particular, sudden chemical changes in the outermost crystal rims indicate that the eruptions were triggered by recharge of less evolved magma. Recalculated melt compositions reveal that magma input is chemically heterogeneous.

<h2>Abstract</h2> <p>Nevado de Toluca is a stratovolcano in the densely populated Mexican Highland and the source of three late Pleistocene Plinian eruptions. While the characterization of the magmatic processes and timescales, leading to these events, is crucial to evaluate potential signals of the reawakening of this volcano, they are not well constrained. Here we present insights gathered from the analysis of mineral zoning. Abrupt changes in plagioclase compositions (anorthite [An] &gt;10 mol. %) record repeated thermochemical disturbance of a shallow magma reservoir prior to the three eruptions investigated. In particular, sudden chemical changes in the outermost crystal rims indicate that the eruptions were triggered by recharge of less evolved magma. Recalculated melt compositions reveal that magma input is chemically heterogeneous. Orthopyroxene compositions span a large range (En<sub>53</sub>‐En<sub>92</sub>, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> of up to 0.9 wt. %) resulting from magma hybridization, which is consistent with a late‐stage temperature increase recorded by amphibole chemistry. Using diffusion chronometry, we show that this recharge typically occurs decades to centuries before Plinian eruptions and hence on timescales relevant for volcano monitoring. Additionally, modeling of Mg profiles in plagioclase constraints the duration of differentiation cycles to be millennial in order of magnitude. Our study shows that similar processes preceded explosive eruptions from Nevado de Toluca, suggesting that analogous paths of unrest should be considered when evaluating potential future activity. We emphasize that signs of deep crustal activity, such as relatively broad deformation pattern surrounding the volcano, could herald the reactivation of Nevado de Toluca.</p>

The Lithic Component of Pyroclastic Deposits as a Proxy for the Reconstruction of the Syneruptive Evolution of Volcanic Conduits: The CE 79 Eruption of Vesuvius
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Dynamics of explosive eruptions is often strongly controlled by temporal changes in conduit geometry. Quantitative constraints to this problem are difficult to define, but basic information on the lithic fraction in pyroclastic deposits can be used as an input of numerical models to infer conduit and crater evolution in terms of shape and dimension. Field data on the 79 CE Pompeii eruption (Vesuvius, Italy) are used here to constrain depth‐dependent variations in conduit geometry. The different lithology of the accidental components, resulting from the erosion of a conduit/crater system crosscutting a well‐known subsurface stratigraphy, helps in defining the provenance depth of the eroded fragments. We reproduced the eruption evolution by considering three periods of the Plinian phase, associated with the white phonolitic pumice clasts (EU2a) and the tephro‐phonolitic gray pumice clasts (EU3a and EU3b). Results constrain the evolution of key eruptive parameters and are consistent with the estimates of mass discharge rate (MDR) and volume of eroded lithic fragments, which require the involvement of conduit geometries with depth‐dependent diameters rather than a constant‐radius shape. The onset of the Plinian phase (EU2a) was characterized by intense crater excavation processes. The MDR increase during the transition from EU2 to EU3 coincided with a significant increase of conduit diameter at bottom. After the peak of MDR (EU3b), a significant deeping of the fragmentation level and an abrupt inlet pressure drop probably occurred. Exit pressure and velocity would have decreased during all the Plinian phase, consistent with a shift to a collapsing column dynamics.

Magmatic‐Hydrothermal Alteration Mechanism for Late Mesozoic Remagnetization in the South China Block
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Although the late Mesozoic remagnetization of the South China Block (SCB) is well recognized, the mechanism is unclear due to poor constraints on the genesis of secondary magnetic minerals. This issue is addressed via the study of the world's largest Paleozoic Mn deposit, in which both early Paleozoic sedimentation of manganese carbonate minerals and undated hydrothermal overprinting manifested by the presence of Mn silicate minerals with associated magnetite. Laser ablation‐inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry in situ element analyses and paleomagnetic studies are applied to determine the age of hydrothermal alteration, and the results shed new light on the remagnetization mechanism of the SCB. Laser ablation‐inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry in situ analyses show that the secondary magnetites have high values of (Ca + Al + Mn) and low values of (Ti + V) and (Ni/Cr)/Ti. This, together with coexisting skarn formation, supports a hydrothermal origin. The postfolding remagnetization is characterized by a stable component and a systematic normal polarity, carried by magnetite. The mean direction has a declination of 22.9° and an inclination of 56.1°, with a statistical parameter α95 of 4.1°. Comparison with previously reported paleopoles indicates that the remagnetization was mostly acquired during the Late Cretaceous. Therefore, our results confirm that the hydrothermal magnetite carries a chemical remanent magnetization as a result of Late Cretaceous skarn formation. From a regional perspective, hydrothermal alteration from the Middle Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous, covering most parts of SCB, is proposed to be one of the important mechanisms for the ubiquitous late Mesozoic remagnetization.

The Significance of Tomographic Edge Zones for Large Earthquakes in Taiwan
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Seismogenesis of large earthquakes in Taiwan are often controlled by regional tectonics. Despite decades of efforts, the detailed relationship between seismogenesis of disastrous earthquakes and the geophysical properties of the earth materials remains unclear. In this study, we conduct high‐resolution tomography inversion of seismic velocities (Vp and Vs) and the Poisson's ratio (σ), and the results are used to infer the three‐dimensional (3‐D) distributions of crack density (ε) and saturation rate (ζ). We find that more than 70% of large (moment or local magnitudes ≥6, M6+) earthquakes occurred along tomographic edge zones (TEZ) within the crust where the spatial gradient exceeds 0.1, including all three disastrous events in the past two decades: the 1999 M7.6 Chi‐Chi, 2016 M6.5 Meinung, and the 2018 M6.4 Hualien earthquakes. We attribute the preference of large crustal earthquakes along TEZ as the consequence of fluid migration from the more saturated side to the opposite, leading to the build‐up of high pore pressure along TEZ. Locations of historical M6+ earthquakes are consistent with the inference of excessive fluids from either the extensive dehydration of hydrous minerals within the subducting Philippine Sea plate or the sedimentary compaction of alluvium and clastic deposits in the foreland basin west of the orogenic belt. Positive correlation between M6+ earthquakes and TEZ is not unique to Taiwan. Several famous earthquakes in regions with different tectonic settings appear to be associated with local TEZ. Our study could provide insights to long‐term mitigation of regional seismic hazards in Taiwan and probably elsewhere.

TX2019slab: A New P and S Tomography Model Incorporating Subducting Slabs
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Large numbers of earthquakes occur in subduction zones that are marked by dipping, narrow high seismic velocity slabs. The existence of these fast velocity slabs can cause serious earthquake mislocation problems that can bias estimates of seismic travel time residuals. This can affect the recovery of subducting slabs in tomography as well as introduce significant artifacts into lower mantle structure in tomography models. In order to better account for known subducting slabs, we performed a new P and S wave joint tomography inversion incorporating a three‐dimensional thermal model of subducting slabs in the starting model. In addition, velocity and source locations were inverted for simultaneously. Our new P and S models feature higher‐amplitude subducting slabs compared with previous global tomography results. The S to P heterogeneity ratio based on the new tomography model indicates that thermal elastic effects alone cannot explain all the heterogeneities in the lower mantle. Much of the observed abnormal S to P heterogeneity ratio can be explained by anelastic effects, the spin transition, and phase transitions of bridgmanite to post‐perovskite in the lower mantle.

Fe Alloy Slurry and a Compacting Cumulate Pile Across Earth's Inner‐Core Boundary
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Seismic observations show a reduced compressional‐wave velocity gradient at the base of the outer core relative to the preliminary reference Earth model and seismic wave asymmetry between the east‐west hemispheres at the top of the inner core. Here we propose a model for the inner core boundary (ICB), where a slurry layer forms through fractional crystallization of an Fe alloy at the base of the outer core (F layer) above a compacting cumulate pile at the top of the inner core (F′ layer). Using recent mineral physics data, we show that fractional crystallization of an Fe alloy (e.g., Fe‐Si‐O) with a solid fraction of ~15 ± 5% and preferential light element partitioning into the liquid can explain the observed reduced velocity gradient in the F layer. The compacting cumulate pile in the F′ layer may exhibit lateral variations in thickness between the east‐west hemispheres due to lateral variations of large‐scale heat flux in the outer core, which may explain the east‐west asymmetry observed in the seismic velocity. Our model suggests that the inner core solid has a high shear viscosity >1022 Pa/s.

Dynamic Topography Development North of Iceland from Subaerial Exposure of the Igneous Logi Ridge, NE Atlantic
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The Logi Ridge, located north of the West Jan Mayen Fracture Zone, is E‐W oriented and 140–150 km long. The seafloor surrounding the Logi Ridge is ∼0.65 km shallower than the conjugate seafloor east of the Mohn's Ridge, attributed to asymmetry in the regional NE Atlantic dynamic uplift. Eight reflection seismic lines across the Logi Ridge constrain its development. Both the western and eastern parts have flat tops, indicating erosion at sea level. Three different basement types surrounding the Logi Ridge are observed: rough basement represents abyssal hills original or reactivated by later magmatic/tectonic events; smooth basement caused by basalt flows overprinting early sediments; and irregular basement formed by later basalt flows and intrusions. The surrounding sediments have two distinct units, where the unit boundary is Middle Miocene (12–14 Ma). Mass transport from the Logi Ridge appears episodically throughout Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene, when development ends. The end of erosion age can also be estimated from seamount height, or present top seamount depth. In the west there is agreement with the age constrained by the sedimentation, proving little dynamic topography change. In the east, discrepancies between the methods are explained by 0.15–0.3 km dynamic uplift after submergence. Hence, most of the regional dynamic uplift occurred before the end of the Logi Ridge development in the Middle Miocene, suggesting a causative relationship. Minor recent magmatic growth and seafloor uplift over a ∼100 km wide zone southeast of the Logi Ridge may be tied to the younger dynamic uplift in the east.

Constraining the Oceanic Lithosphere Seismogenic Zone Using Teleseismic Relocations of the 2012 Wharton Basin Great Earthquake Sequence
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The great 2012 Mw 8.6 strike‐slip earthquake beneath the Wharton Basin generated a complex aftershock sequence that maps onto a system of conjugate faults. Analysis of high‐precision aftershock locations with improved depth constraint is used here to characterize the seismogenic limits of the oceanic lithosphere. The study presents teleseismic double‐difference earthquake relocation results for 695 events in and around the 2012 Wharton Basin intraplate earthquake sequence. We highlight seven major clusters of seismicity and show that the 2012 earthquake sequence ruptured in the oceanic crust and upper mantle. The refined aftershock locations projected onto available mainshock finite‐fault models show that aftershocks occur outside the largest coseismic slip region and tend to cluster in low slip areas, a pattern commonly seen for large continental and megathrust sequences. For events with depth phases, the relocated focal depths generally correspond to predicted depths from pP‐P time observations. Reported pP‐P observations for intraplate events correspond to depths ranging from ~5 to 35–40 km, such that the deepest events occur within the expected limit of brittle seismic failure at 600 °C, here defined by a half‐space cooling model of the region. The 74 low magnitude events in our catalog that locate below the 600 °C isotherm do not have consistent depth phase observations and cannot be interpreted as strong evidence of rupture into the ductile regime. The refined double‐difference catalog supports that, along with deep coseismic rupture, moderate‐sized earthquakes ruptured across the full extent of the elastic oceanic lithosphere in the Wharton Basin.

Long‐Term Coupling and Feedback Between Tectonics and Surface Processes During Non‐Volcanic Rifted Margin Formation
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Here we present high‐resolution 2‐D coupled tectonic‐surface processes modeling of extensional basin formation. We focus on understanding feedbacks between erosion and deposition and tectonics during rift and passive margin formation. We test the combined effects of crustal rheology and varying surface process efficiency on structural style of rift and passive margin formation. The forward models presented here allow to identify the following four feedback relations between surface processes and tectonic deformation during rifted margin formation. (1) Erosion and deposition promote strain localization and enhance large offset asymmetric normal fault growth. (2) Progressive infill from proximal to more distal half grabens promotes the formation of synthetic sets of basinward dipping normal faults for intermediate crustal strength cases. (3) Sediment loading on top of undeformed crustal rafts in weak crust cases enhances middle and lower crustal flow resulting in sag basin subsidence. (4) Interaction of high sediment supply to the distal margin in very weak crust cases results in detachment‐based rollover sedimentary basins. Our models further show that erosion efficiency and drainage area provide a first‐order control on sediment supply during rifting where rift‐related topography is relatively quickly eroded. Long‐term sustained sediment supply to the rift basins requires elevated onshore drainage basins. We discuss similar variations in structural style observed in natural systems and compare them with the feedbacks identified here.

Seismic Noise in Central Alaska and Influences From Rivers, Wind, and Sedimentary Basins
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Ambient noise is useful for characterizing frequency‐dependent noise levels and for assessing data quality for seismic stations. We use 4 years of ambient noise spectra from 16 stations in central Alaska to examine environmental and structural influences on seismic stations. The region contains a major river (Tanana River) that is ice covered for half the year and is underlain by a sedimentary basin (Nenana basin) that strongly influences the seismic wavefield. Nenana basin amplifies ambient seismic noise by 12–16 dB at 0.1–0.7 Hz and 17–30 dB at 0.7–3 Hz. A meteorological station and river gauge at Nenana provide environmental data for comparison with seismic stations. During the summer, the Tanana River produces noise levels elevated by 30–40 dB at frequencies near 10 Hz, as recorded by all five stations within 100 m of the main river channel. The Tanana River sediment is predominantly silt and sand in this region; therefore, we attribute the 10‐Hz river signal to turbulence within the water and to unsteady shearing on the river bottom. The influence of wind is apparent on seismic noise at low (<0.05 Hz) frequencies, due to atmospheric‐induced tilting, and at high (>2.0 Hz) frequencies, due to unsteady shearing and turbulence near the ground. Our empirical findings motivate future studies, such as how flow from air or water couples to the ground and how deep sedimentary basins influence the ambient noise wavefield. Our results have implications for seismic site selection, environmental monitoring, and detection and characterization of earthquakes.

The Deep Lithospheric Structure of the Junggar Terrane, NW China: Implications for Its Origin and Tectonic Evolution
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) is one of the world's largest and oldest accretionary orogens. The Junggar Terrane, located in the southwestern CAOB, is considered a key tectonic element to understand the evolution of the whole CAOB. However, given the lack of xenoliths and limited geophysical data with sensitivities to mantle depths, the nature of its basement and its deep lithospheric structure are still highly debated. Here we use a probabilistic inverse method to jointly invert newly processed Rayleigh wave dispersion data, surface heat flow, geoid anomalies, and absolute elevation. The output is a 3‐D model of the seismic, temperature, bulk density, and compositional structure of the whole lithosphere beneath the western part of the Junggar Terrane. Our results reveal a subduction‐shaped mantle anomaly beneath the western flank of the Junggar Basin that resembles closely the structure of a fossil subduction zone. We also confirm the presence of a thick lower crust beneath the basin with properties similar to those of basaltic rocks. On account of these results, we further conduct a hypothesis test and demonstrate that an “oceanic model” for the origin of the basement of the Junggar Basin explains the available geophysical and geochemical information better than other alternative models. Based on all these observations, we propose an evolutionary model for the western Junggar Terrane that reconciles a number of previously conflicting interpretations.

Seafloor Geodesy in Shallow Water With GPS on an Anchored Spar Buoy
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Measuring seafloor motion in shallow coastal water is challenging due to strong and highly variable oceanographic effects. Such measurements are potentially useful for monitoring near‐shore coastal subsidence, subsidence due to petroleum withdrawal, strain accumulation/release processes in subduction zones and submerged volcanoes, and certain freshwater applications, such as volcano deformation in caldera‐hosted lakes. We have developed a seafloor geodesy system for this environment based on an anchored spar buoy topped by high‐precision GPS. Orientation of the buoy is measured using a digital compass that provides heading, pitch, and roll information. The combined orientation and GPS tracking data are used to recover the three‐dimensional position of the seafloor marker (anchor). A test system has been deployed in Tampa Bay, Florida, for over 1 year and has weathered several major storms without incident. Even in the presence of strong tidal currents which can deflect the top of the buoy several meters from vertical, daily repeatability in the corrected three‐component position estimates for the anchor is 1–2 cm or better.

The Effect of Earthquake Kinematics on Tsunami Propagation
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Tsunamis are one of the most destructive effects of subduction zone earthquakes. Directly observing and understanding the generation and propagation of tsunamis remains challenging due to limited offshore instrumentation and a sparse catalog of large events. This makes linking characteristics of the earthquake rupture to their effect on tsunami generation difficult. While past studies explored how varying earthquake source geometries affect tsunami nucleation, little has been done to examine the role of the kinematic component of rupture on the tsunami; we explore these effects in this study. While past studies have examined the kinematic effect using coastal tide gauge data, we expand this examination to more recent pressure gauges. We identify a consistent rotation of the main beam of tsunami energy when using a kinematic model, affecting far‐field hazards. We also identify a delay in tsunami arrival times at both coastal and open‐ocean gauges that can be as long as the total source duration. For large earthquakes, this delay introduces nonnegligible mapping errors when employing open‐ocean tsunami data for source characterizations. As a result of our findings we recommend including a kinematic component to tsunami modeling when studying events with source durations over 120 s and using recordings from open‐ocean pressure gauges. We also find that when focusing purely on coastal gauge data and near‐source hazards, the kinematic component is a much smaller contribution to the source uncertainty and can be ignored.

A Thick Negative Polarity Anomaly in a Sediment Core From the Central Arctic Ocean: Geomagnetic Excursion Versus Reversal
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract There are two distinctly different views on Quaternary sedimentation rates in the central Arctic Ocean, namely, that they were on cm/kyr or on mm/kyr scales, largely as a result of divergent interpretations of magnetic reversal stratigraphy. This study provides new evidence to help resolve this controversy in the form of an almost 1‐m‐thick negative polarity interval located at ~1.15 m below the seafloor in a 4.15‐m‐long sediment core from the Lomonosov Ridge, central Arctic Ocean. This thick polarity anomaly was first revealed through alternating field demagnetization of natural remanent magnetization on u‐channel samples. It was subsequently confirmed to be an authentic signal of a syndepositional geomagnetic field by integrating detailed rock magnetic studies, transmission electron microscopy with energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy analyses of magnetic extracts, and both alternating field and thermal demagnetization of discrete paleomagnetic samples. Here we conclude that it is more reasonable to interpret the reversed interval as a record of the Matuyama Chron rather than a Brunhes‐aged excursion, which yields mean sedimentation rates of ~1.5 mm/kyr and ~0.5 mm/kyr in the Brunhes and Matuyama Chrons, respectively. These estimates are remarkably lower than assumed in most recent studies, but in good agreement with both previous magnetostratigraphic and recent geochemical studies relative to the decay of Be and U‐series isotopes, which might indicate “sediment‐starved” environments at least in some parts of this region. Overall, our results not only imply that chronostratigraphy in the central Arctic Ocean remains open to debate but also warrant further investigations in this microfossil‐barren region.

<h2>Abstract</h2> <p>There are two distinctly different views on Quaternary sedimentation rates in the central Arctic Ocean, namely, that they were on cm/kyr or on mm/kyr scales, largely as a result of divergent interpretations of magnetic reversal stratigraphy. This study provides new evidence to help resolve this controversy in the form of an almost 1‐m‐thick negative polarity interval located at ~1.15 m below the seafloor in a 4.15‐m‐long sediment core from the Lomonosov Ridge, central Arctic Ocean. This thick polarity anomaly was first revealed through alternating field demagnetization of natural remanent magnetization on u‐channel samples. It was subsequently confirmed to be an authentic signal of a syndepositional geomagnetic field by integrating detailed rock magnetic studies, transmission electron microscopy with energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy analyses of magnetic extracts, and both alternating field and thermal demagnetization of discrete paleomagnetic samples. Here we conclude that it is more reasonable to interpret the reversed interval as a record of the Matuyama Chron rather than a Brunhes‐aged excursion, which yields mean sedimentation rates of ~1.5 mm/kyr and ~0.5 mm/kyr in the Brunhes and Matuyama Chrons, respectively. These estimates are remarkably lower than assumed in most recent studies, but in good agreement with both previous magnetostratigraphic and recent geochemical studies relative to the decay of Be and U‐series isotopes, which might indicate “sediment‐starved” environments at least in some parts of this region. Overall, our results not only imply that chronostratigraphy in the central Arctic Ocean remains open to debate but also warrant further investigations in this microfossil‐barren region.</p>

Fracture Unclogging: A Numerical Study of Seismically Induced Viscous Shear Stresses in Fluid‐Saturated Fractured Rocks
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Dynamic shaking imposed by passing seismic waves is able to promote various hydrological processes in fractured reservoirs. This is often associated with seismically induced fracture unclogging due to mobilization of deposited colloids in the fracture network which, in turn, affects permeability at the reservoir scale. Numerous laboratory and field studies pointed out that fracture unclogging can be initiated when viscous shear stresses in the fracture fluid are in the range of 0.1–1 Pa. In this numerical study, we compute viscous shear stress in a fluid‐saturated fractured medium due to the action of passing P and S waves. We perform a sensitivity analysis in terms of fluid, fracture, and host rock physical properties as well as seismic wave characteristics. Our results show that seismically induced viscous shearing increases with frequency and seismic strain and can be in the order of those initiating fracture unclogging for typical seismic strains and frequencies. S waves tend to produce viscous shearing approximately 2 times larger than P waves, and, for anisotropic distribution of fractures, it is extremely dependent on the direction of wave propagation. Moreover, larger viscous shearing is expected for more viscous fluids and stiffer host rocks. Regarding the fracture network distribution, for the same fracture density, the presence of longer fractures drastically increases the potential of fracture unclogging at seismic frequencies. The fracture aperture distribution, on the other hand, can also affect the development of viscous shearing. Fractures with correlated distributions of contact areas exhibit an order of magnitude larger viscous shearing than uncorrelated ones.

Modeling Satellite Gravity Gradient Data to Derive Density, Temperature, and Viscosity Structure of the Antarctic Lithosphere
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract In this study we combine seismological and petrological models with satellite gravity gradient data to obtain the thermal and compositional structure of the Antarctic lithosphere. Our results indicate that Antarctica is largely in isostatic equilibrium, although notable anomalies exist. A new Antarctic Moho depth map is derived that fits the satellite gravity gradient anomaly field and is in good agreement with independent seismic estimates. It exhibits detailed crustal thickness variations also in areas of East Antarctica that are poorly explored due to sparse seismic station coverage. The thickness of the lithosphere in our model is in general agreement with seismological estimates, confirming the marked contrast between West Antarctica (<100 km) and East Antarctica (up to 260 km). Finally, we assess the implications of the temperature distribution in our model for mantle viscosities and glacial isostatic adjustment. The upper mantle temperatures we model are lower than obtained from previous seismic velocity studies. This results in higher estimated viscosities underneath West Antarctica. When combined with present‐day uplift rates from GPS, a bulk dry upper mantle rheology appears permissible.

Mapping Deep Electrical Conductivity Structure in the Mount Isa region, Northern Australia: Implications for Mineral Prospectivity
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The Mount Isa Province in northern Australia is one of the world's most strongly endowed regions for base metals and host to major iron–oxide–copper–gold (IOCG) deposits. The Carpentaria conductivity anomaly at the eastern margin of the province is a major electrical conductivity structure of the Australian continent. We use magnetotelluric data to image the crustal architecture in this highly mineralized region. The resistivity models reveal a number of prominent crustal‐scale conductors, suggesting that the Carpentaria conductivity anomaly is likely caused by a series of isolated or interconnected bodies. These conductors confirm the position and geometry of the ancient Gidyea Suture zone, the eastern boundary of the Mount Isa Province, interpreted as a west‐dipping subduction zone. The Carpentaria conductivity anomaly may record the activity of fluid dehydration involved during a subduction event, with the enhanced conductivity likely being caused by deformation or mineralization of graphitic or sulfidic rocks during orogenesis. The major iron oxide in the Ernest Henry IOCG deposit located in the hanging wall of the Gidyea Suture zone is magnetite, suggesting another possible conductive source. The distribution of known gold and copper deposits shows a close spatial correlation with the suture zone, suggesting that this structure is potentially a fundamental control on IOCG deposits in its vicinity. The implication is that crustal‐penetrating structures act as potential pathways for fluid movement to form mineral deposits in the upper crust. The significance of mapping such structures using geophysics is highlighted for mineral exploration.

The Accommodation of the South Flank's Motion by the Koa‘e Fault System, Kīlauea, Hawai‘i: Insights From the June 2012 Earthquake Sequence
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The Koa‘e fault system is a prominent and complex structural element of Kīlauea Volcano, Hawai‘i. On 5 June 2012, a sequence of shallow earthquakes occurred in the central part of the Koa‘e fault system. The Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data from multiple satellites spanning the time of the earthquake occurrence indicate a maximum of ~10‐cm surface displacement above the seismic events in the Koa‘e. The Global Positioning System (GPS) data from multiple stations show that there was a slow slip event in the south flank in late May 2012. Field visits to the fault after the earthquakes revealed ground cracks. In this study, we combine the seismic, InSAR, GPS data, and field observations to investigate the characteristics of the Koa‘e fault system. We relocate the seismic events in the central part of the Koa‘e fault system, compute the focal mechanisms for the events in the June 2012 earthquake sequence, invert for a two‐fault model based on the surface deformation, and discuss their relationships with the 2012 slow slip event. Based on our Coulomb stress‐change calculation, we infer that the 2012 slow slip event may have triggered both the seismic events and the surface deformation and played a major role in the evolution of the Koa‘e fault system and the accommodation of the south flank's motion. Our integrated analyses are helpful to constrain the fault geometry in the Koa‘e system and to shed light on the role of Koa‘e in the structural evolution of Kīlauea.

Direct Inversion for Three‐Dimensional Shear Wave Speed Azimuthal Anisotropy Based on Surface Wave Ray Tracing: Methodology and Application to Yunnan, Southwest China
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Azimuthal anisotropy retrieved from surface waves is important for constraining depth‐varying deformation patterns in the crust and upper mantle. We present a direct inversion technique for the three‐dimensional shear wave speed azimuthal anisotropy based on mixed‐path surface wave traveltime data. This new method includes two steps: (1) inversion for the 3‐D isotropic Vsv model directly from Rayleigh wave traveltimes and (2) joint inversion for both 3‐D Vsv azimuthal anisotropy and additional 3‐D isotropic Vsv perturbation. The joint inversion can significantly mitigate the trade‐off between strong heterogeneity and anisotropy. With frequency‐dependent ray tracing based on 2‐D isotropic phase speed maps, the new method takes into account the ray‐bending effect on surface wave propagation. We apply the new method to a regional array in Yunnan, southwestern China. Using Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion data in the period band of 5–40 s extracted from ambient noise interferometry, we obtain a 3‐D model of shear wave speed and azimuthal anisotropy in the crust and uppermost mantle in Yunnan. This model reveals that two midcrust low‐velocity zones are possible weak channels, and the azimuthal anisotropy at a depth of 5 to 30 km is mainly controlled by nearby strike‐slip faults, some of which also approximately coincide with the lateral boundaries of the crustal low‐velocity zones. Approximately south of 26°N, the upper crustal azimuthal anisotropy from our model is significantly different from the upper mantle anisotropy inferred by shear wave splitting, indicating different deformation styles between the crust and upper mantle in southern Yunnan.

The Effect of Brine on the Electrical Properties of Methane Hydrate
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Gas hydrates possess lower electrical conductivity (inverse of resistivity) than either seawater or ice, but higher than clastic silts and sands, such that electromagnetic methods can be employed to help identify their natural formation in marine and permafrost environments. Controlled laboratory studies offer a means to isolate and quantify the effects of changing individual components within gas‐hydrate‐bearing systems, in turn yielding insight into the behavior of natural systems. Here we investigate the electrical properties of polycrystalline methane hydrate with ≥25% gas‐filled porosity and in mixture with brine. Initially, pure methane hydrate was synthesized from H2O ice and CH4 gas while undergoing electrical impedance measurement, then partially dissociated to assess the effects of pure pore water accumulation on electrical conductivity. Methane hydrate + brine mixtures were then formed by either adding NaCl (0.25–2.5 wt %) to high‐purity ice or by using frozen seawater as a reactant. Conductivity was obtained from impedance measurements made in situ throughout synthesis while temperature cycled between +15 °C and −25 °C. Several possible conduction mechanisms were subsequently determined using equivalent circuit modeling. Samples with low NaCl concentration show a doping/impurity effect and a log linear conductivity response as a function of temperature. For higher salt content samples, conductivity increases exponentially with temperature and the log linear relationship no longer holds; instead, we observe phase changes within the samples that follow NaCl–H2O–CH4 phase equilibrium predictions. Final samples were quenched in liquid nitrogen and imaged by cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryo‐SEM) to assess grain‐scale characteristics.

Low‐Frequency Seismicity at Villarrica Volcano: Source Location and Seismic Velocities
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Villarrica Volcano (Chile) is one of the most active volcanoes in South America. Its low‐frequency (≤5 Hz) seismicity consists of a continuous tremor, overlain by impulsive transient events of higher amplitude in 60‐s intervals. This signal was recorded in March 2012 by an extensive local network, comprising 75 stations and including 6 subarrays. It allowed us to apply and compare three techniques to locate the origin of the seismicity: intersection of propagation directions determined by array analysis, mapping amplitudes, and modeling of amplitude decay. All methods yield almost identical, temporally stable, epicenters inside the summit crater, which confirms earlier attributions of the seismicity to volcanic activity inside the conduit. The discrete transients and the interevent tremor share the same source location. From the dominance of surface waves and the obvious scattering, we infer a source near the surface. For two arrays at the northern and western flank, a dispersion relation was derived, which allowed for the determination of S wave velocity‐depth functions. At both locations, the velocity structure can be modeled by three layers with interfaces at 100 and 400m depths. The velocities (300 to 3,000 m/s) correspond to pyroclastic material at different states of consolidation. The modeling of the amplitude decay reveals a quality factor around 50.

The Effects of Shear Strain, Fabric, and Porosity Evolution on Elastic and Mechanical Properties of Clay‐Rich Fault Gouge
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The elastic and mechanical properties of fault gouge are key controls on fault zone stiffness, strength, damage, healing, and sliding stability. Clay minerals are prevalent in fault zones and have significant effects on friction, porosity, elastic properties, and shear fabric development. Although clay‐rich gouges are well studied, the roles of porosity evolution and fabric formation in modulating elastic and mechanical properties are unclear. We have found that with progressive shear, the role of strain localization and fabric development may compete with densification to control the evolution of friction and elastic moduli. We report on a suite of double‐direct shear experiments on synthetic gouge composed of 50% Ca‐montmorillonite and 50% granular quartz at a normal stress of 25 MPa. We measure the coefficient of friction, porosity, P and S wave speeds, and bulk and shear moduli, and their evolution with shearing, to shear strains up to ~25. We find that the evolution of Vp, Vs, and elastic moduli are controlled by the interplay of porosity loss, shear fabric development, and particle contact stiffness. In general, Vp, Vs, and elastic moduli increase with shear strain and are accompanied by gradual densification and porosity loss. However, at intermediate shear strains (~2–8) a decrease in Vp, Vs, and elastic moduli is superimposed on this overall trend. Based on previous microstructural studies, we hypothesize that fabrics develop parallel to shear direction (perpendicular to wave propagation) over this range of strains, leading to reduced fault stiffness and competing with porosity loss as the dominant control on elastic properties.

Late Miocene Hinterland Crustal Shortening in the Longmen Shan Thrust Belt, the Eastern Margin of the Tibetan Plateau
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Long‐term (million year time scale) fault‐slip history is crucial for understanding the processes and mechanisms of mountain building in active orogens. Such information remains elusive in the Longmen Shan, the eastern Tibetan Plateau margin affected by the devastating 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. While this event drew attention to fault deformation on the foreland side (the Yingxiu‐Beichuan fault), little is known about the deformation history of the hinterland Wenchuan‐Maoxian fault. To address this gap, thermochronological data were obtained from two vertical transects from the Xuelongbao massif, located in the hanging wall of the Wenchuan‐Maoxian fault. The data record late Miocene rapid cooling and rock exhumation at a rate of 0.9–1.2 km/m.y. from ~13 Ma to present. The exhumation rate is significantly higher than that in the footwall (~0.3–0.5 km/m.y.), indicating a differential exhumation of ~0.6 km/m.y. across the fault. This differential exhumation provides the first and minimum constraint on the long‐term throw rate (~0.6 km/m.y) of the Wenchuan‐Maoxian fault since the late Miocene. This new result implies continuous crustal shortening along the hinterland fault of Longmen Shan, even though it has not been ruptured by major historic earthquakes. Our study lends support to geodynamic models that highlight crustal shortening as dominating deformation along the eastern Tibetan Plateau.

Separation of Sources of Seasonal Uplift in China Using Independent Component Analysis of GNSS Time Series
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract With the improvement of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observation accuracy and the establishment of large continuously operating networks, long GNSS time series are now widely used to understand a range of Earth deformation processes. The continuously operating stations of the Crustal Movement Observation Network of China capture deformation signals due to time‐dependent tectonic, nontectonic mass loading, and potentially unknown geophysical processes. In order to separate and recover these underlying sources accurately and effectively, we apply the independent component analysis (ICA) to decompose the observed time series of vertical displacements. Then, we compare these signals with those predicted from independently developed geophysical process models of atmospheric, nontidal ocean, snow, soil moisture mass loading, and the Land Surface Discharge Model, as well as with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment observations. For comparison, we also perform the principal component analysis decomposition of time series and find that the ICA achieves a more consistent representation of multiple geophysical contributors to annual vertical GNSS displacements. ICA can decompose the long‐term trend and different seasonal and multiannual signals that closely correspond to the independently derived mass loading models. We find that independent contributions from atmospheric, soil moisture, and snow mass loading can be resolved from the GNSS data. Discrepancies are likely due to the correlated nature of some of the loading processes and unmodeled contributions from groundwater and surface water changes in South Central China and the Ganges Basin.

Rheology and Biostratigraphy of the Mariana Serpentine Muds Unravel Mud Volcano Evolution
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract In late 2016, the IODP Expedition 366 drilled 21 holes on summits and flanks of three serpentinite mud volcanoes (SMVs) of the Mariana Forearc: Yinazao (Blue Moon), Fantangisña (Celestial), and Asùt Tesoru (Big Blue). The drilling reached the forearc sediments underneath the SMVs only at Site U1498 where, according to data from this study, the biostratigraphic age of Fantangisña appears to be well constrained, with a pelagic cover on top of the serpentine mud flows of 0.44 Ma and an age of the forearc sediments of 11.21 Ma. With an estimated age of at least 10.77 Myr this is, to our knowledge, the oldest mud volcano ever dated. To link the age of the edifice with its eruptive dynamics, we performed rheological tests of natural samples of serpentine mud from the Fantangisña SMV for the first time. These experiments not only confirm the highly viscous characteristic of the mud breccia but also identify different muds' mineralogical compositions (i.e., serpentine‐rich vs. serpentine‐poor sediments) and water contents as being responsible for the main rheological variations. The viscosity from the rheological data, together with the physical properties of the mud breccia and the clasts measured onboard IODP366, under several assumptions, allow us to estimate of flow velocities and a depth of the mud source at ∼8.4 km below seafloor. Moreover, comparison of erupted mud breccia volumes from bathymetry, seismic data, and calculations shows how the SMV evolution is linked to episodic events, highlighting that Fantangisña has actively been expelling sediments during 2.41% of its life span.

Tectonic Regionalization of the Southern California Crust From Tomographic Cluster Analysis
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We map crustal regions in Southern California that have similar depth variations in seismic velocities by applying cluster analysis to 1.5 million P and S velocity profiles from the three‐dimensional tomographic model CVM‐S4.26. We use a K‐means algorithm to partition the profiles into K sets that minimize the inter‐cluster variance. The regionalizations for K ≤ 10 generate a coherent sequence of structural refinements: each increment of K introduces a new region typically by partitioning a larger region into two smaller regions or by occupying a transition zone between two regions. The results for K ≤ 7 are insensitive to initialization and trimming of the model periphery; nearly identical results are obtained if the P and S velocity profiles are treated separately or jointly. The regions for K = 7 can be associated with major physiographic provinces and geologic areas with recognized tectonic affinities, including the Continental Borderland, Great Valley, Salton Trough, and Mojave Desert. The regionalization splits the Sierra Nevada and Peninsular Range batholiths into the western and eastern zones consistent with geological, geochemical, and potential‐field mapping. Three of the regions define a geographic domain comprising almost all of the upper crust derived from continental lithosphere. Well‐resolved regional boundaries coincide with major faults, topographic fronts, and/or geochemical transitions mapped at the surface. The consistent alignment of these surface features with deeper transitions in the crustal velocity profiles indicates that regional boundaries are typically narrow, high‐angle structures separating regions with characteristic crustal columns that reflect different compositions and tectonic histories.

Style and Distribution of Slip at the Margin of a Pull‐Apart Structure: Geodetic Investigation of the Southern Dead Sea Basin
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We present a new analysis of crustal deformation along the southern Dead Sea pull‐apart basin, located at the southern part of the Dead Sea Fault (DSF). Using geodetic measurements of new and dense Global Positioning System network, we obtain the station velocities across the margin of this structure. We run a set of 2‐D and 3‐D models and find that the total left‐lateral strike‐slip rate of ~4.8 mm/yr is divided between the western (Sedom Fault) and eastern main boundary faults of the pull‐apart basin. Different locking depths of the western and eastern boundary faults suggest asymmetrical basin. General extension of the southern Dead Sea basin of ~0.4 mm/yr and additional shallow extension of ~0.5 mm/yr of the Sedom Fault is observed. The southern fault boundary, the Amazyahu transverse Fault, is obliquely deformed in the general direction of the DSF, transferring ~2.5 mm/yr of slip rate from southeast to northwest. The Sedom and Amazyahu faults are also found to be creeping at shallow depths and at steady rates. The depth of shallow creep correlates with the depth of thick rock salt layers deposited within the basin. The rock salt probably serves as lubricant material on the fault with a relatively low friction coefficient. This unique situation allows the fault to creep at almost constant velocity. Our observations suggest that shallow creep may also occur along additional segments of the DSF where thick rock salt layers are relatively shallow.

<h2>Abstract</h2> <p>We present a new analysis of crustal deformation along the southern Dead Sea pull‐apart basin, located at the southern part of the Dead Sea Fault (DSF). Using geodetic measurements of new and dense Global Positioning System network, we obtain the station velocities across the margin of this structure. We run a set of 2‐D and 3‐D models and find that the total left‐lateral strike‐slip rate of ~4.8 mm/yr is divided between the western (Sedom Fault) and eastern main boundary faults of the pull‐apart basin. Different locking depths of the western and eastern boundary faults suggest asymmetrical basin. General extension of the southern Dead Sea basin of ~0.4 mm/yr and additional shallow extension of ~0.5 mm/yr of the Sedom Fault is observed. The southern fault boundary, the Amazyahu transverse Fault, is obliquely deformed in the general direction of the DSF, transferring ~2.5 mm/yr of slip rate from southeast to northwest. The Sedom and Amazyahu faults are also found to be creeping at shallow depths and at steady rates. The depth of shallow creep correlates with the depth of thick rock salt layers deposited within the basin. The rock salt probably serves as lubricant material on the fault with a relatively low friction coefficient. This unique situation allows the fault to creep at almost constant velocity. Our observations suggest that shallow creep may also occur along additional segments of the DSF where thick rock salt layers are relatively shallow.</p>

Pressure‐Induced Coordination Changes in a Pyrolitic Silicate Melt From Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Simulations
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract With ab initio molecular dynamics simulations on a Na‐, Ca‐, Fe‐, Mg‐, and Al‐bearing silicate melt of pyrolite composition, we examine the detailed changes in elemental coordination as a function of pressure and temperature. We consider the average coordination as well as the proportion and distribution of coordination environments at pressures and temperatures encompassing the conditions at which molten silicates may exist in present‐day Earth and those of the Early Earth's magma ocean. At ambient pressure and 2,000 K, we find that the average coordination of cations with respect to oxygen is 4.0 for Si‐O, 4.0 for Al‐O, 3.7 for Fe‐O, 4.6 for Mg‐O, 5.9 for Na‐O, and 6.2 for Ca‐O. Although the coordination for iron with respect to oxygen may be underestimated, the coordination number for all other cations are consistent with experiments. By 15 GPa (2,000 K), the average coordination for Si‐O remains at 4.0 but increases to 4.1 for Al‐O, 4.2 for Fe‐O, 4.9 for Mg‐O, 8.0 for Na‐O, and 6.8 for Ca‐O. The coordination environment for Na‐O remains approximately constant up to core‐mantle boundary conditions (135 GPa and 4000 K) but increases to about 6 for Si‐O, 6.5 for Al‐O, 6.5 for Fe‐O, 8 for Mg‐O, and 9.5 for Ca‐O. We discuss our results in the context of the metal‐silicate partitioning behavior of siderophile elements and the viscosity changes of silicate melts at upper mantle conditions. Our results have implications for melt properties, such as viscosity, transport coefficients, thermal conductivities, and electrical conductivities, and will help interpret experimental results on silicate glasses.

Contemporary Mountain‐Building of the Tianshan and its Relevance to Geodynamics Constrained by Integrating GPS and GRACE Measurements
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The present‐day deformation of the Tianshan Mountain range is largely resulting from the collision between India and the Eurasian plate, but the mechanism causing its uplift remains controversial. In this study, we present the contemporary tectonic and geodynamic processes resulting in the growth of the Tianshan Mountain range as revealed by integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) measurements during 2010–2016. The average ground uplift rate is 0.72 ± 0.12 mm/year, of which 0.39 mm/year is attributed to elastic effects of glacier melting. The residual average tectonic uplift rate of 0.33 ± 0.12 mm/year closely matches the crustal thickening rate (0.33 ± 0.03 mm/year), indicating that horizontal compression plays an essential role in Tianshan orogeny. We also find the Lake Issyk‐Kul region is converging and subsiding, which can be explained by a regional crust folding model. The interaction of adjacent rigid blocks in the Tianshan and surrounding areas is also manifested by the crustal shortening derived from GPS horizontal velocities. This study provides new geodetic results and a new model in current orogenic movement in the Tianshan Mountain range and highlights its complexity.

Long‐Term Stability of Tilt‐Controlled gPhoneX Gravimeters
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Spring relative gravimeters are considered too unstable to provide useful information on long‐term gravity variations. In this paper, we prove that the new generation of spring gravimeter gPhoneX can reach long‐term stability at the μGal level (10 nm s−2) when the verticality of the gravimeter is maintained, if the instrumental drift can be correctly estimated. We conducted two comparisons with different gPhoneXs in different observatories and environmental conditions. In the “Walferdange Underground Laboratory for Geodynamics” in Luxembourg, we compared time series from the gPhoneX (with and without tilt control), with data from a superconducting gravimeter. We found an agreement at the μGal level when the tilt control is switched on. We validated this result by repeating the experiment at the “Geodesy in Karstic Environment” observatory in the south of France. The fit between the superconducting gravimeter and the gPhoneX hourly values gives similar results at all frequencies over 276 days of measurements. The linear correlation coefficient between the gPhoneX and superconducting gravimeter reaches 0.99, with a misfit of 6.0 nm s−2. We demonstrated that tilt‐controlled gPhoneXs are suitable for long‐term gravity monitoring.

Amplitude Source Location Method With Depth‐Dependent Scattering and Attenuation Structures: Application at Nevado del Ruiz Volcano, Colombia
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The amplitude source location (ASL) method, which uses high‐frequency amplitudes based on the assumption of isotropic radiation of S waves, was tested with envelope waveforms simulated from depth‐dependent scattering and attenuation structures at Nevado del Ruiz volcano, Colombia. Our test results indicate that estimated ASLs are more accurate when a two‐layer attenuation model is used than when a homogenous attenuation model is used, as has commonly been done in previous studies. We applied the ASL method with a two‐layer attenuation model to the high‐frequency (5‐10 Hz) band of volcanotectonic (VT) earthquakes, long‐period (LP) and very long period (VLP) events, and tremor recorded in 2016 at Nevado del Ruiz. Results indicate that the differences between ASLs and VT earthquake hypocenters (determined using onset arrival times) were smaller for a two‐layer model compared to a homogeneous model. Our determined ASLs for LP and VLP events and tremor were distributed along a NW‐dipping plane beneath the summit crater, near and above a region with high P to S wave velocity ratios that has been interpreted as shallow magma storage. This plane may represent weak zones along the Palestina fault system. Our results suggest that LP and VLP events and tremor occur during magma ascent along the fault system. This study demonstrates that the ASL method with a depth‐dependent attenuation model is useful to improve the accuracy of estimated source locations for volcanoseismic signals.

Dynamic Evolution of Permeability in Response to Chemo‐Mechanical Compaction
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Pressure‐solution creep is an important fluid‐mediated deformation mechanism, causing chemo‐mechanical transformations and porosity and permeability changes in rocks. The presence of phyllosilicates, in particular, has previously been hypothesized to further reduce porosity and pore connectivity. Nevertheless, a full characterization of the spatiotemporal evolution of permeability during this process has yet to be reported. A pure NaCl aggregate and a mixture of NaCl and biotite were deformed through pressure‐solution creep while monitoring their microstructural evolution through computed X‐ray microtomography. The evolution of permeability and fluid velocity of the samples were computed by using the pore geometries from the X‐ray microtomography as input for the Lattice‐Boltzmann modeling. The results indicate that, as deformation proceeds, porosity and permeability decrease in both samples. In the salt‐biotite sample pressure solution creep causes the formation of a compaction band perpendicular to the direction of loading, forming a barrier for permeability. Along the other two directions, pore connectivity and permeability are retained in the marginal salt layers, making the sample strongly anisotropic. The presence of biotite controls the way pore coordination number evolves and hence the connectivity of the pathways. Biotite flakes create an enhanced porosity decrease leading to compaction and reduction of pore connectivity. This reduction in porosity affects local stresses and local contact areas, reducing over time the driving force. According to a texture‐porosity process, the reduction in porosity causes salt ions to dissolve in the marginal salt and precipitate within the biotite‐bearing layer, where the bulk volume of salt grains increases over time.

Modeling Megathrust Earthquakes Across Scales: One‐way Coupling From Geodynamics and Seismic Cycles to Dynamic Rupture
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Taking the full complexity of subduction zones into account is important for realistic modeling and hazard assessment of subduction zone seismicity and associated tsunamis. Studying seismicity requires numerical methods that span a large range of spatial and temporal scales. We present the first coupled framework that resolves subduction dynamics over millions of years and earthquake dynamics down to fractions of a second. Using a two‐dimensional geodynamic seismic cycle (SC) model, we model 4 million years of subduction followed by cycles of spontaneous megathrust events. At the initiation of one such SC event, we export the self‐consistent fault and surface geometry, fault stress and strength, and heterogeneous material properties to a dynamic rupture (DR) model. Coupling leads to spontaneous dynamic rupture nucleation, propagation, and arrest with the same spatial characteristics as in the SC model. It also results in a similar material‐dependent stress drop, although dynamic slip is significantly larger. The DR event shows a high degree of complexity, featuring various rupture styles and speeds, precursory phases, and fault reactivation. Compared to a coupled model with homogeneous material properties, accounting for realistic lithological contrasts doubles the amount of maximum slip, introduces local pulse‐like rupture episodes, and relocates the peak slip from near the downdip limit of the seismogenic zone to the updip limit. When an SC splay fault is included in the DR model, the rupture prefers the splay over the shallow megathrust, although wave reflections do activate the megathrust afterward.

Effects of Fault Roughness on Coseismic Slip and Earthquake Locations
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Fault zone structure is well known to exert strong controls on earthquake properties including coseismic slip distribution, rupture propagation direction, and hypocenter location. It has also been well established that the principal slip surface, which accommodates the majority of earthquake displacement, exhibits roughness at all scales following self‐affine fractal distributions. Here we explore the relationship between fault roughness and specific earthquake properties including coseismic slip distribution and hypocenter location based on long‐term simulations of earthquake catalogs on fractally rough faults. We begin by using the von Kármán autocorrelation function to procedurally generate single faults with different fractal roughness properties, which we place in a homogeneous elastic solid and apply pure right‐lateral shear at a constant back slip rate with the earthquake simulator RSQSim. Running the simulations for 10,000 years each, we generate millions of earthquakes including thousands of events with Mw > 6.0, which rupture the surface. We show that the patterns of surface rupture in these large events follow self‐affine fractal distributions with consistent fractal dimension related distinctly to the fractal dimension of the fault. In addition, the hypocenters of these large events occur in very specific predictable locations where the longest wavelength structure produces a stress asperity (i.e., restraining bend). The resulting patterns can explain many features observed on real fault systems, including clustered hypocenter locations, spatially variable coseismic slip distributions, and characteristic slip recurrence behavior. These results demonstrate a quantitative link between a directly measurable fault property—roughness—and the properties of future earthquakes.

Viscoelasticity of Liquid Iron at Conditions of the Earth's Outer Core
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Viscosity and elasticity are material properties essential for understanding the composition, dynamics, and evolution of the Earth's core, yet their intrinsic connection as embedded in the general theory of viscoelasticity is not well explored. Here we use molecular dynamics to determine the viscoelasticity of liquid iron at conditions of the Earth's outer core. The frequency‐dependent viscosity and shear modulus are determined from the power spectrum of the stress autocorrelation function. We find that the stress autocorrelation function is well characterized by a generalized Maxwell model containing two relaxation modes. The mode with shorter relaxation time (τ1) corresponds to the motion of individual atoms; the other with longer relaxation time (τ2) is associated with collective motions. As temperature (T ) decreases, the slow‐decaying mode becomes more prominent with increasingly larger τ2. In contrast, τ1 remains nearly constant (∼0.016 ps). The infinite frequency shear modulus (G∞), which characterizes the instantaneous shear response, is found to be larger than the static shear modulus of hexagonal close‐packed (hcp) iron of the same density and increases linearly with T. Based on these findings as well as seismic analyses (Tsuboi & Saito, 2002, https://doi.org/10.1186/BF03351717; Krasnoshchekov et al., 2005, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature03613), the zero frequency viscosity (η0) of the lowermost outer core is inferred as 109 Pa·s. The likely material states exhibiting such viscosities are discussed. Moreover, we show that to retain the rigidity consistent with seismic observations, the η0 of the inner core should be at least 1013 Pa·s.

High‐Resolution 3‐D P Wave Velocity Structures Under NE Taiwan and Their Tectonic Implications
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract First P wave arrival‐time data from local earthquakes recorded by a dense geophone array deployed on the Ilan Plain and by existing permanent stations were combined to invert for high‐resolution P wave velocity structures under northeast Taiwan. With relatively high resolution, we were able to examine the structures in more detail and to investigate their significance and tectonic implications. We introduce two distinct groups of proposals for mechanisms of subduction polarity flipping in Taiwan, referred to as the “tear model” and “breakoff model.” While the predicted Philippine Sea Plate boundaries differ between the two models, those of the breakoff model and the related subducting indenter model are geodynamically similar. The surface junction and the west edge of the imaged high Vp anomalous Philippine Sea Plate comply with those predicted by the subducting indenter model and thus favor the breakoff model over the tear model. While the observed high Vp anomalous region in the mantle wedge can be explained as eclogitization of previously subducted crust, eclogitization of the overriding continental crustal roots cannot be ruled out. Those beneath the Taipei Basin and the Tatun Volcano Group exhibit a pattern potentially connected to the low Vp anomalies in the mantle wedge, suggesting the involvement of the Philippine Sea slab, either by asthenospheric upwelling due to extensional collapse or by fluid migration due to slab dehydration. Those beneath the Ilan Plain exhibit a low Vp pattern extending to deeper origins in the eastern offshore region, suggesting a connection with the opening of the Okinawa Trough.

Jurassic–Early Cenozoic Tectonic Inversion in the Qilian Shan and Qaidam Basin, North Tibet: New Insight From Seismic Reflection, Isopach Mapping, and Drill Core Data
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The pre‐Cenozoic structural pattern of Asia has had a strong impact on the localization and propagation of the Cenozoic deformation that gave birth to the Tibetan Plateau. Northern Tibet represents a key area to decipher the structural and kinematic links between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic evolution of Tibet. Nonetheless, the Mesozoic tectonic setting of the North Tibet and the role that the Paleozoic inherited Altyn Tagh Fault (ATF) shearing zone played in controlling the regional tectonic pattern during the deposition of the Mesozoic strata remain controversial. This study is based on seismic reflections, isopach maps of the Mesozoic strata in the Qaidam Basin, and provenance analysis using detrital zircon geochronological and heavy mineral contents. Seismic reflections and isopach maps demonstrate that sustained strike‐slip motion along the ATF during the Early to Late Jurassic induced transtensional basin formation. Further away from the main ATF (eastern parts of the Qilian Shan and the northern Qaidam Basin), transtension also occurred along major faults, although local transpression developed in relay zones. Rotation in the regional stress field induced compression and basin inversion during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. The Cenozoic sedimentary rocks in these regions display widespread growth strata and angular unconformities characteristic of compression. This is consistent with topographic changes marked by sediment source variation evidenced by detrital zircon geochronology and heavy mineral analysis. We propose that the mechanism driving the Jurassic extension/transtension in North Tibet could be related to far‐field effects of subduction processes along the southern margins of the continent.

Copper Isotope Variations During Magmatic Migration in the Mantle: Insights From Mantle Pyroxenites in Balmuccia Peridotite Massif
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The crust shows large variations in Cu isotopic composition (δ65Cu relative to NIST 976) resulting from redox reactions and other supergene processes. The significant range of δ65Cu in mantle peridotites thus could be ascribed to recycled crustal materials and/or oxidative mantle metasomatism. However, the influence of normal magmatic fractionation processes on δ65Cu variations remains poorly understood, and it is unclear whether the magmatic processes also lead to large δ65Cu variations in mantle rocks. To address the issue, we present bulk‐rock δ65Cu of fresh mantle pyroxenites from the Balmuccia peridotite massif, Northern Italy. These pyroxenites formed by melt‐peridotite reaction and mineral accumulation from MORB‐ to OIB‐like, sulfide‐saturated basic magmas. Mass balance calculations show that sulfide phases host >98 wt % of the Cu budget of bulk rocks (87−484 μg/g). The pyroxenites show significant variations of δ65Cu from −0.66‰ to 0.66‰, which cover the range known for peridotites, including metasomatized ones. Three subsamples from the same pyroxenite layer display >0.3‰ decrease in δ65Cu with progressive differentiation. Nevertheless, δ65Cu does not display correlations with indicators of magmatic differentiation (e.g., Mg# and Cu/Pd) for all pyroxenites in this study. This might be attributed to variable extents of magmatic sulfide segregation for different samples and/or varying δ65Cu of the pyroxenite parent magmas, which were also affected by reactive migration through peridotites. The combined processes can change δ65Cu of evolving magmas and reacted peridotites and lead to Cu isotopic heterogeneity in the mantle, without involvement of oxidative metasomatism or recycled crustal materials.

Complete Three‐Dimensional Coseismic Deformation Field of the 2016 Central Tottori Earthquake by Integrating Left‐ and Right‐Looking InSAR Observations With the Improved SM‐VCE Method
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The three‐dimensional (3‐D) deformation field associated with the 2016 Central Tottori earthquake is retrieved from advanced land observing satellite 2 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations with four different viewing geometries, that is, ascending/descending tracks and left‐/right‐looking modes. The strain model and variance component estimation (SM, VCE, SM‐VCE) method is exploited and improved to integrate the InSAR observations with different viewing geometries so that the 3‐D deformation field is not affected by the inconsistent coverage of SAR footprints or the gross errors in InSAR observations. The obtained results are consistent with GNSS observations, indicating that the improved SM‐VCE method, known as SM‐RVCE in this paper, is capable of retrieving an accurate and spatially complete 3‐D deformation field for this earthquake. In addition, the precision of the InSAR observations and the estimated 3‐D deformation are quantitatively assessed by the SM‐RVCE method. Finally, on the basis of the estimated 3‐D coseismic deformation, the source parameters of this event are inverted, revealing an asperity with a maximum strike‐parallel slip of ~1.1 m concentrated at depths between 2 and 10 km. The estimated seismic moment is 2.4 × 1018 Nm, which corresponds to a Mw 6.2 event.

New Insight Into a Volcanic System: Analogue Investigation of Bubble‐Driven Deformation in an Elastic Conduit
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Analogue and numerical simulations have been widely used to describe the mechanisms of bubble and slug ascent during volcanic eruptions as well as their formation and explosion mechanisms. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanical interaction between the fluid and the surrounding medium. In this work, we report the results from analogue experiments designed to show how deformation of the conduit walls induced by the rising slugs is related to the radiation and propagation of seismic and geodetic signals. For the first time, we investigate the dynamics of bubbles in an elastic conduit unveiling the relationship between slugs and crustal strain accumulation around the conduit. Moreover, we discuss the retroactive effects of the deformed conduit wall on the dynamics of a rising slug, particularly, how the flow is affected, and the eventual implications on the intensity of the eruption. Our results show that the combination of an elastic conduit with a large volume of gas may lead to the development of a new type of slug, here defined as a “super slug,” characterized by tapering towards the tail and a much higher ascent velocity and inner pressure compared with ordinary slugs. This newly observed behavior could be linked to vigorous explosive events.

Laboratory Insight Into Seismic Estimates of Energy Partitioning During Dynamic Rupture: An Observable Scaling Breakdown
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We investigate energy partitioning using seismological methods of seismic ruptures with estimated submicron levels of slip in the laboratory. Estimates inferred from recorded seismic waves are founded on microscale phenomenological friction experiments in the laboratory and appear to be constrained by inherent assumptions. In this concerted study, we build on the methods used to absolutely calibrate an array of piezoelectric transducers in a direct shear laboratory apparatus. We found that flat‐broadband sensor behavior allowed us to study source extent parameters using spectral source models that are typically used to interpret small to moderate‐sized earthquakes. We computed the corner frequencies, low‐frequency plateaus, and high‐frequency spectral falloff exponent using single‐station assumptions. Moment magnitude ranged from −9<Mw<−7.5 and slip was on the order of nanometers to micrometers—extending our understanding of source parameters studied via seismic waves. A number of findings are highlighted: (i) Variations in spectral falloff with corner frequencies followed the observations made in natural conditions. (ii) Corner frequency shift phenomenon was observed (fcP/fcS∼ 1.34) and was attributed to source finiteness rather than wave propagation effects. (iii) Events were stress overshoot as determined by the Savage‐Wood efficiency. (iv) The empirical power law scaling relationship between fracture energy and slip, given as , where nG=1.28 appears to break down with seismological estimates made at the mining scale (nG=1.86) and laboratory scale (nG=2.35). This break in scaling may be related to the types of off‐fault energy sinks that are inherently captured in the seismological interpretation of fracture energy.

Deformation of Granular Aggregates: Static and Dynamic Bulk Moduli
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Sand and glass bead samples were monotonically loaded from zero to 50 MPa and then monotonically unloaded, all under hydrostatic stress conditions. Sand deformed irreversibly and its porosity loss was permanent. In contrast, the glass beads deformation was almost fully reversible with the initial porosity recovered. During loading, the static bulk modulus in all sand samples increased from zero to about 0.5 GPa between zero and 15 MPa stress and remained constant for the remainder of the loading. Such behavior, somewhat unexpected in a granular system, means that sand deforms as a linear elastic body during loading from 15 to 50 MPa. The unloading behavior was very different ‐‐ the static bulk modulus almost linearly decreased from about 4 GPa at 50 MPa to zero as the stress was reduced. Once again, this behavior was very different from that observed in glass beads, where the static bulk modulus during loading was essentially the same as during unloading and appeared to be a unique function of stress, independent of the direction of its variation. Moreover, the static and dynamic bulk moduli in glass beads, the latter computed from Vp, Vs, and density measured during the loading/unloading cycle, were very close to each other. In contrast, the dynamic bulk modulus in dry sand exceeded the static modulus during unloading by a factor of 1.5 to 2.0. We used a quantitative theory based on contact mechanics and the concept of stress heterogeneity in particulates to analytically match the observed results.

Numerical Modeling of Mantle Flow Beneath Madagascar to Constrain Upper Mantle Rheology Beneath Continental Regions
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Over the past few decades, azimuthal seismic anisotropy measurements have been widely used proxy to study past and present‐day deformation of the lithosphere and to characterize convection in the mantle. Beneath continental regions, distinguishing between shallow and deep sources of anisotropy remains difficult due to poor depth constraints of measurements and a lack of regional‐scale geodynamic modeling. Here, we constrain the sources of seismic anisotropy beneath Madagascar where a complex pattern cannot be explained by a single process such as absolute plate motion, global mantle flow, or geology. We test the hypotheses that either Edge‐Driven Convection (EDC) or mantle flow derived from mantle wind interactions with lithospheric topography is the dominant source of anisotropy beneath Madagascar. We, therefore, simulate two sets of mantle convection models using regional‐scale 3D computational modeling. We then calculate Lattice Preferred Orientation that develops along pathlines of the mantle flow models and use them to calculate synthetic splitting parameters. Comparison of predicted with observed seismic anisotropy shows a good fit in northern and southern Madagascar for the EDC model, but the mantle wind case only fits well in northern Madagascar. This result suggests the dominant control of the measured anisotropy may be from EDC, but the role of localized fossil anisotropy in narrow shear zones cannot be ruled out in southern Madagascar. Our results suggest that the asthenosphere beneath northern and southern Madagascar is dominated by dislocation creep. Dislocation creep rheology may be dominant in the upper asthenosphere beneath other regions of continental lithosphere.

Determining crack aperture distribution in rocks using the 14C‐PMMA autoradiographic method: experiments and simulations
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Because cracks control the global mechanical and transport properties of crystalline rocks, it is of a crucial importance to suitably determine their aperture distribution, which evolves through alteration processes and rock weathering. Due to the high variability of crack networks in rocks, a multi‐scale approach is needed. The 14C‐PMMA (PolyMethylMethAcrylate) method was developed to determine crack apertures using a set of artificial crack samples with different controlled apertures and tilt angles, and also using Monte Carlo simulations. The experiments and simulations show the same result: the estimation of apparent aperture wA was successful regardless of tilt angle, even if the estimates are less accurate for low tilt angles (< 30°). The uncertainties on the estimation of the real crack aperture wR arise from the unknown tilt angle. The ability of the 14C‐PMMA autoradiography method in order to estimate crack aperture distributions in rock samples was successfully confirmed on a sample of Grimsel granodiorite.

Magnesium and lithium isotopic evidence for a remnant oceanic slab beneath central Tibet
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The voluminous Eocene post‐collisional potassium‐rich magmatism in central Tibet is crucial in understanding the deep geodynamic process and related uplift history of the Tibetan Plateau. Here, we present an integrated study of whole‐rock Sr‐Nd‐Mg‐Li isotopes and zircon U‐Pb ages on two suites of lavas from Duocaima and Nariniya in the northern Qiangtang block. The Duocaima high‐K calc‐alkaline trachyandesites were formed at ~35 Ma and are enriched in LREEs and LILEs. They have slightly lower δ26Mg (‐0.41 to ‐0.33‰) and δ7Li (+1.0 to +2.6‰) relative to the mantle. Together with their high 87Sr/86Sr(i) (0.7066‐0.7067) and low ɛNd(t) (‐1.96 to ‐1.61) values, they most likely originated from the lithospheric mantle previously metasomatized by melts from subducted carbonate‐bearing sediments. Model calculation suggests that ~7‐11% sediments were added into the mantle via melting. By contrast, the contemporaneous Nariniya adakitic trachytes have higher δ26Mg (‐0.13 to ‐0.02‰) and δ7Li (+3.3 to +5.4‰) values, as well as higher Pb/Ce and Ba/La ratios, which most likely resulted from the thickened lower crust that was metasomatized by fluids released from downgoing Songpan‐Ganzi oceanic slab. Our combined isotopic study suggests the existence of a remnant oceanic slab beneath central Tibetan Plateau during the late Eocene and implies that the initial uplift of the central Tibet was before ~38 Ma.

Shear velocity inversion using multimodal dispersion curves from ambient seismic noise data of USArray/Transportable Array
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We utilize an array method called the frequency‐Bessel transformation method (F‐J method) to extract the multimodal dispersion curves of Rayleigh waves from ambient seismic noise data recorded by the USArray/TA. We observe as many as 5 overtones' dispersion curves of Rayleigh waves in the Midwestern U.S., and 4 and 3 overtones' dispersion curves, respectively, in the U.S. Great Plain area and Northeastern US. We employ a quasi‐Newton method to invert the multimodal dispersion curves for the shear velocity. We find that overtones' information imposes extremely strict constraints on the shear velocity inversion, thereby significantly reducing the non‐uniqueness of the inversion on the basis of the fundamental mode.

<h2>Abstract</h2> <p>We utilize an array method called the frequency‐Bessel transformation method (F‐J method) to extract the multimodal dispersion curves of Rayleigh waves from ambient seismic noise data recorded by the USArray/TA. We observe as many as 5 overtones' dispersion curves of Rayleigh waves in the Midwestern U.S., and 4 and 3 overtones' dispersion curves, respectively, in the U.S. Great Plain area and Northeastern US. We employ a quasi‐Newton method to invert the multimodal dispersion curves for the shear velocity. We find that overtones' information imposes extremely strict constraints on the shear velocity inversion, thereby significantly reducing the non‐uniqueness of the inversion on the basis of the fundamental mode. The sensitivity of overtones to deeper structures is higher than that of fundamental mode in the same frequency range. The utilization of overtones greatly improved the non‐uniqueness and convergence of the inversions, which make the final inversion results robust and reliable. Our inversion results for Vs model in the studied areas exhibit some differences compared with Shen and Ritzwoller's model [2016]. The Vs falls abruptly in the lower crust (21<span>~</span>33 km) in the U.S. Great Plain area and Northeastern US areas; A high‐velocity zone is observable in depth of 50<span>~</span>60 km in the U.S. Great Plain area and Midwestern U.S.; And all three models show larger Vs values below 50 km than those of <i>Shen and Ritzwoller</i> [2016].</p>

Deformation of Intrasalt Beds Recorded by Magnetic Fabrics
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Intrasalt beds comprise sedimentary layers within a weak rock salt mass. Thick intrasalt beds (hundred meter scale) are common in salt structures, yet their internal deformation has not been investigated in detail as outcrops of such beds are rare. In this study, we explore the internal deformation of thick intrasalt beds exposed along the Sedom salt wall in the Dead Sea Basin. These beds are highly deformed and form a kilometer‐scale recumbent fold. We measured the magnetic fabrics from six sites along these beds. Magnetic fabrics reflect the preferred alignment of crystals and grain shapes and are a proven kinematic marker in deformed rocks. Our analysis shows that the magnetic fabrics are mostly controlled by the preferred orientation of clay minerals. The orientations of the principal susceptibility axes vary along the salt wall regardless of the specific rock type. Minimum susceptibility axes (K3 axes) are normal to bedding, whereas maximum susceptibility axes (K1 axes) are subparallel to bedding strike. We suggest that the magnetic fabrics were acquired by strain imposed at a necked region along a subsurface fault, together with folding during passive diapirism. Generally, the magnetic fabrics have not been influenced by the later stage of active diapirism, which led to emergent beds at the surface. Nevertheless, in sites from the upper limb of the recumbent fold, the magnetic fabrics were further deformed by folding at the base of a salt glacier. Our results demonstrate that thick intrasalt beds are mechanically distinct from the encasing flowing salt and preserve information on salt tectonic processes operating at depth.

Adakite‐Like Potassic Magmatism and Crust‐Mantle Interaction in a Postcollisional Setting: An Experimental Study of Melting Beneath the Tibetan Plateau
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Adakite‐like potassic rocks are widespread in postcollisional settings where they provide potential insights into deep crustal processes that include partial melting, lower crustal flow and thickening, plateau uplift, and the creation of porphyry metal deposits. Although substantial progress has been made in characterizing the geochemical and geophysical features of postcollisional adakite‐like potassic rocks, their petrogenesis remains controversial. Here we report direct experimental evidence for the origins of these rocks with partial melting experiments on (1) garnet amphibolite and (2) the same garnet amphibolite mixed with 20 wt. % of a primitive Tibetan shoshonite. The experiments were conducted at 1.5–2.0 GPa and 800–1,000 °C. The partial melts of garnet amphibolite have typical adakitic signatures and are calc‐alkalic but lack the enrichment in potassium and other strongly incompatible elements (Rb, Ba, Th, U) that are characteristic of Tibetan adakite‐like rocks. In contrast, all characteristic features of the natural adakite‐like rocks are convincingly reproduced by the hybrid experiments. This includes negative inflections for Nb, Ta, and Ti on mantle‐normalized plots which are inherited from source materials rather than the effects of rutile in melting residues. The input of mantle‐derived shoshonitic mafic melts to a crustal source can be argued to provide not only the high concentrations of incompatible elements characteristic of adakite‐like potassic magmas but also the heat necessary for crustal melting. Our experimental results demonstrate that, in the case of the Tibetan Plateau at least, the production of adakite‐like potassic rocks in postcollisional settings can be best explained by such a model.

Water Permeability Evolution With Faulting for Unconsolidated Turbidite Sand in a Gas‐Hydrate Reservoir in the Eastern Nankai Trough Area of Japan
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Gas hydrates in sediments are forecast to become an unconventional natural gas resource. In 2013 and 2017, an offshore natural gas production test in subseabed gas hydrate‐bearing sand layers was carried out in the eastern Nankai Trough area of Japan. However, permeability evolution with progressive shearing of these faulted reservoirs has remained enigmatic. It is necessary to understand fault behavior under shear, as well as how normal stress affects permeability evolution. Here, we examine the relationship between fault development and permeability reduction in unconsolidated turbidite sandy sediment from Japan's eastern Nankai Trough area using a laboratory ring‐shear experiments. At each stress condition, the permeability decreased significantly following shear displacements of ~0.2–0.5 m, gradually decreasing further with shear displacements up to 10 m. Permeability after shearing was reduced by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude compared to that before shearing. Grain crushing and compaction within the shear zone and surrounding host sediment are dependent on stress and mineralogy. The findings of the role of shear zone development in modifying fault permeability for turbidite sand are expected to contribute directly to rational evaluation of gas‐hydrate reservoir, production simulations, and development strategies in future studies.

Offset Channels May Not Accurately Record Strike‐Slip Fault Displacement: Evidence From Landscape Evolution Models
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Slip distribution, slip rate, and slip per event for strike‐slip faults are commonly determined by correlating offset stream channels—under the assumption that they record seismic slip—but offset channels are formed by the interplay of tectonic and geomorphic processes. To constrain offset channel development under known tectonic and geomorphic conditions, we use numerical landscape evolution simulations along a theoretical strike‐slip fault with uniform and steady uplift, erosion, and diffusion. We investigate the influence of four tectonic parameters (fault zone width, earthquake recurrence interval, variance of the recurrence interval, and total slip relative to channel spacing) on offset channel development through multiple earthquake cycles. Analysis of >3,000 automatically measured offsets from >135 simulations suggests ~30% variability in individual measurements, but modeled displacement is recovered by averaging multiple measurements. However, the average of multiple offset measurements systematically underestimates modeled slip except when the fault zone is less than ~5 m wide, total slip is less than channel spacing, and offsets are measured shortly after an earthquake. In these simulations, postearthquake landscape evolution widens the geomorphic expression of the fault zone and modifies apparent channel offsets. We distinguish this “geomorphic fault zone” from the tectonic fault zone (zone of coseismic distributed deformation). This study highlights the capability of landscape evolution models to explore a range of conditions not easily defined in natural examples and the importance of averaging multiple measurements. Our results verify that paleoseismic studies must consider how geomorphic change has modified offset markers and use caution interpreting slip histories with multiple earthquakes.

High‐Saturation Gas Hydrate Reservoirs—A Pore Scale Investigation of Their Formation From Free Gas and Dissociation in Sediments
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The enormous volume of gas stored in methane hydrate reservoirs has attracted worldwide interest. Hydrate reservoirs with hydrate saturations over 60% are considered viable targets for economic production. Although such high‐saturation hydrate reservoirs have been observed in nature, researchers have had difficulty in understanding how they may form and settling on best strategies for their production. Here we examined how high‐saturation methane hydrate deposits form from free gas in nature by synthesizing high‐saturation hydrate specimens in the laboratory by emulating natural conditions and monitoring hydrate formation using a high‐resolution micro‐computed tomography (micro‐CT) scanner. The results confirmed that free methane injection into water‐saturated sediments results in high‐saturation hydrate specimens. In addition, we explored gas production from high‐saturation specimens through a series of dissociation experiments. CT scan results show that water is expelled first during depressurization, while produced gas tends to remain trapped in the specimen. The volume of gas produced by thermal stimulation alone could be smaller than that of gas hydrate in deep reservoirs, which demands depressurization to expand the volume of the produced gas to extract gas from the reservoir. High‐saturation reservoirs are prone to flow path clogging during depressurization within hydrate stability zone, which can be mitigated by hydrate dissociation via thermal stimulation or further depressurization crossing the hydrate stability boundary.

<title>Interannual Oscillations in Earth Rotation</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract At seasonal and shorter time scales, polar motion and length‐of‐day (LOD) change are dominated by mass redistribution in the Earth climate system, including the atmosphere, oceans, and hydrosphere. Long‐term polar motion and LOD change are believed to be forced by solid Earth geophysical process, such as glacial isostatic adjustment. Decadal LOD variations are also connected to core‐mantle coupling. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of interannual oscillations in all three components of Earth rotation using accurately measured polar motion and LOD time series, and geophysical excitations computed from atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrological models over the period 1962 to 2018. Strong interannual oscillations remain in all three components after detrending and band‐pass filtering to retain variations at periods between 2 and 8 years. Polar motion Y is dominated by a 3.65‐year oscillation, plus others at periods of 2.5 and 5.9 years. Polar motion X shows a strong oscillation near 5.9 years, plus smaller variations at shorter periods. A 5.9‐year LOD variation has been recognized in earlier studies, but oscillations at periods of 2.36, 3.65, and 4.9 years are also observed. Atmosphere, ocean, and hydrosphere (AOH) sources largely account for 2.5‐ and 3.65‐year components in polar motion Y, but not for the 5.9‐year component in polar motion X and Y. The 2.36‐, 3.65‐, and 4.9‐year components in LOD can largely be accounted for by AOH sources. The 5.9‐year LOD component becomes more prominent after AOH sources have been subtracted. The presence of a 5.9‐year variation in all three components of Earth rotation suggests a source in Earth's interior, probably from the core.

Characterizing the Influence of Fracture Density on Network Scale Transport
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The topology of natural fracture networks is inherently linked to the structure of the fluid velocity field and transport therein. Here we study the impact of network density on flow and transport behaviors. We stochastically generate fracture networks of varying density and simulate flow and transport with a Discrete Fracture Network model, that fully resolves network topology at the fracture scale. We study conservative solute trajectories with Lagrangian particle tracking and find that as fracture density decreases, solute channelization to large local fractures increases, thereby reducing plume spreading. Furthermore, in sparse networks mean particle travel distance increases and local network features, such as velocity zones where flow is counter to the primary pressure gradient, become increasingly important for transport. As the network density increases, network statistics homogenize and such local features have a reduced impact. We quantify local topological influence on transport behavior with an effective tortuosity parameter, which measures the ratio of total advective distance to linear distance at the fracture scale; large tortuosity values are correlated to slow velocity regions.

<h2>Abstract</h2> <p>The topology of natural fracture networks is inherently linked to the structure of the fluid velocity field and transport therein. Here we study the impact of network density on flow and transport behaviors. We stochastically generate fracture networks of varying density and simulate flow and transport with a Discrete Fracture Network model, that fully resolves network topology at the fracture scale. We study conservative solute trajectories with Lagrangian particle tracking and find that as fracture density decreases, solute channelization to large local fractures increases, thereby reducing plume spreading. Furthermore, in sparse networks mean particle travel distance increases and local network features, such as velocity zones where flow is counter to the primary pressure gradient, become increasingly important for transport. As the network density increases, network statistics homogenize and such local features have a reduced impact. We quantify local topological influence on transport behavior with an effective tortuosity parameter, which measures the ratio of total advective distance to linear distance at the fracture scale; large tortuosity values are correlated to slow velocity regions. These large tortuosity – slow velocity regions delay downstream transport and enhance tailing on particle breakthrough curves. Finally, we predict transport with an upscaled, Bernoulli spatial Markov random walk model and parameterize local topological influences with a novel tortuosity parameter. Bernoulli model predictions improve when sampling from a tortuosity distribution, as opposed to a fixed value as has previously been done, suggesting that local network topological features must be carefully considered in upscaled modelling efforts of fracture network systems.</p>

Week‐Long and Year‐Long Slow Slip and Tectonic Tremor Episodes on the South Central Alaska Megathrust
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We jointly investigate aseismic slip transients and tremor activity in south central Alaska. Near the eastern downdip edge of the Mw 9.2 1964 Prince Williams earthquake rupture, kinematic modeling of the Mw=7.6 2009–2013 slow slip event suggests cumulative transient slip of up to 55 cm. During this 5‐year transient event, tectonic tremors were co‐located with the inferred aseismic slip zone and occurred in week‐long bursts of events. A short‐term transient deformation event is observed in the GPS time series spanning a tremor burst in September 2010. The time‐dependent slip modeling of this Mw=6.9 subevent shows that it migrated along strike with tremor at speeds of ∼8 km/day and with slip rates of ∼3 mm/day. It released 9% of the 5‐year transient event total moment in 1.4% of its duration. The decomposition of GPS time series relative to tremor times during the whole 5‐year transient event shows that GPS site velocities were on average three to six times higher during tremor bursts than in between, suggesting that slip pulses are generally associated with tremor bursts. This inference is strengthened by the decomposition of the GPS time series after the 5‐year‐long deformation event, during which the plate interface is being loaded in between the short‐duration events and slips at times of tremor bursts. The 5‐year‐long transient deformation event could either represent a cluster of short‐term events or be the sum of short‐term ETS events and a smooth long‐term slip event located updip.

Recordings of Fast Paleomagnetic Reversals in a 1.2 Ma Greigite‐Rich Sediment Archive From Lake Ohrid, Balkans
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract State‐of‐the‐art paleoclimate research strongly depends on the availability of time‐equivalent markers as chronological control to disentangle interrelationships in the climate system from regional to global scale. Geomagnetic reversals are regarded as excellent age constraints because they are global events and independent from climatic conditions. However, spatial variations of timing and internal dynamics of reversals may limit their precision. Our 1.2 Ma high‐resolution (~25 cm/kyr) sediment record from Lake Ohrid is promising to precisely depict the Matuyama‐Brunhes (MB) reversal and the Jaramillo subchron. Two generations of diagenetic ferrimagnetic minerals are present in glacial intervals of the Lake Ohrid record. Early diagenetic greigite acquired a quasi synsedimentary chemical magnetization, while a late diagenetic greigite formation, triggered by the upward diffusion of H2S‐rich waters, obscures the polarity record at the top of the Jaramillo. Interglacial intervals are unaffected by greigite formation, likely due to low iron concentrations. Based on an orbitally tuned age model with tephrostratigraphic markers, the base of Jaramillo can be precisely dated to 1072.4 ka, and the MB reversal to 778.5 ka. Both polarity reversals occurred very rapidly in our record, lasting 2.3 and 1 kyr, respectively. Our results reveal that the dipole component of the Earth's magnetic field fell below the nondipole components only for a short duration in the Mediterranean region. The comparison of the timing of the MB boundary across different archives implies that the onset of the reversal provides a more synchronous age marker compared to often used midpoint ages.

Evolution of the Josephine Peridotite Shear Zones: 2. Influences on Olivine Cpo Evolution
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Seismic anisotropy arises in the upper mantle due to the alignment of olivine crystal lattices and is often used to interpret mantle flow direction. Experiments on the evolution of olivine crystal‐preferred orientation (CPO) have found that the texture that develops is dependent on many factors, including water content, differential stress, preexisting CPO, and deformation kinematics. To evaluate the role of these factors in naturally deformed samples, we present microstructural transects across three shear zones in the Josephine Peridotite. Samples from these shear zones exhibit a mixture of A‐type textures, which have been associated with dry conditions and primary activation of the olivine [100](010) slip system, and of E‐type textures, which have been associated with wetter conditions and primary activation of the [100](001) slip system. CPOs with characteristics of both A‐type and E‐type textures are also present. CPO type does not evolve systematically as a function of either strain or water content. We used a micromechanical model to evaluate the roles of preexisting texture and kinematics on olivine CPO evolution. We find that the preexisting texture controls CPO evolution at strains up to 5 during simple shear. Kinematics involving a combination of simple shear and pure shear can explain the olivine CPOs at higher strain. Hence, preexisting CPOs and deformation kinematics should be considered in the interpretation of CPOs measured in naturally deformed rocks and of large‐scale patterns in upper‐mantle seismic anisotropy.

Quantifying the effects of non‐diffuse noise on ballistic and coda wave amplitude from variances of seismic noise interferometry in Southern California
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We develop a new approach based on the variance of noise cross‐correlation to characterize the noise source and wave propagation under the influence of a non‐diffuse noise field. Based on the standard errors for the Fourier spectra of stacked noise cross‐correlation and the assumption of a diffuse field, we derive an analytical expression for the variance of every time point in the stacked cross‐correlation and validate the theory using synthetic diffuse noise data. The ambient seismic noise field in Southern California is, however, not fully diffuse. The observed correlated neighboring frequencies in the noise data – a definitive character of the non‐diffuse field, map into the noise cross‐correlation, biasing its variances from theoretical predictions under fully diffuse field assumption. For the secondary ocean microseism, we find strong positive correlation between the correlated neighboring frequencies and the deviations from diffuse field theory predicted variances. The ballistic arrivals on average contain more significant bias than the coda segments of the noise cross‐correlation, which agrees with previous time‐lapse monitoring studies based on ambient seismic noise. In addition, the station pairs having significant bias between actual and diffuse field theory predicted variances are aligned with the strongest source direction and exhibit significant beamforming source fluctuation.

Comprehensive detection of very low frequency earthquakes off the Hokkaido and Tohoku Pacific coasts, northeastern Japan
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Very low frequency earthquakes (VLFEs), classified as one type of slow earthquake, occur near seismogenic zones and can be a proxy for interplate slow slip. We investigated VLFE activity off the Hokkaido and Tohoku Pacific coasts, where the Pacific plate subducts under the North American plate. Comprehensive detection of VLFEs is performed for the period from January 2003 to July 2018 by a matched‐filter technique utilizing synthetic waveforms calculated based on a three‐dimensional velocity structure model. The spatiotemporal consistency between the afterslip of the 2003 Tokachi‐Oki earthquake (Mw 8.0) and VLFE distribution off the Hokkaido coast suggests that VLFE activity can reflect interplate slow slip. Inside a large coseismic slip area of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (Mw 9.0), the VLFE activity was low thereafter, whereas outside the area, VLFE activity increased after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. These characteristics are consistent with aseismic slip distributions estimated from repeating earthquakes. VLFEs were sometimes activated by afterslips of interplate earthquakes with Mw of 6–7, such as the 2008 Fukushima‐Oki earthquake and aftershocks of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. Even in the coseismic slip areas of very large earthquakes, we found the occurrence of episodic bursts every three months to a year during an interseismic period between very large earthquakes. Such VLFE bursts may suggest small slips during the interseismic period.

<title>Magmatic Forcing of Cenozoic Climate?</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Established theories ascribe much of the observed long‐term Cenozoic climate cooling to atmospheric carbon consumption by erosion and weathering of tectonically uplifted terrains, but climatic effects due to changes in magmatism and carbon degassing are also involved. At timescales comparable to those of Milankovitch cycles, late Cenozoic building/melting of continental ice‐sheets, erosion and sea level changes can affect magmatism, which provides an opportunity to explore possible feedbacks between climate and volcanic changes. Existing data show that extinction of Neo‐Tethyan volcanic arcs is largely synchronous with phases of atmospheric carbon reduction, suggesting waning degassing as a possible contribution to climate cooling throughout the early to middle Cenozoic. In addition, the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations during the last deglaciation may be ascribed to enhanced volcanism and carbon emissions due to unloading of active magmatic provinces on continents. The deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2 points to a mutual feedback between climate and volcanism mediated by the redistribution of surface masses and carbon emissions. This may explain the progression to higher amplitude and increasingly asymmetric cycles of late Cenozoic climate oscillations. Unifying theories relating tectonic, erosional, climatic, and magmatic changes across timescales via the carbon cycle offers an opportunity for future research into the coupling between surface and deep Earth processes.

Support vector machine classification of seismic events in the Tianshan orogenic belt
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Discriminating between various types of seismic events is of significant scientific and societal importance. We use a machine learning method employing support vector machine (SVM) to classify tectonic earthquakes (TEs), quarry blasts (QBs) and induced earthquakes (IEs) among 30,181 1.5 < ML <2.9 seismic events that occurred in the Tianshan orogenic belt in China from 2009 to 2017. SVM classifiers are derived based on discriminant features of a training dataset consisting of 1,400 TEs selected from the aftershock sequences of 18 ML≥5.0 earthquakes, 2,881 QBs from repeating events occurring in those areas with a percentage of event daytime occurrence greater than 0.9, and 987 IEs from events in the known oil/gas fields and water reservoirs. The discriminant features include spectral amplitudes of observed P and S wave signals in a frequency range of 1‐15 Hz normalized by the P spectrum and averaged over the entire seismic network, and an optional feature of the percentage of event daytime occurrence. Statistics analyses indicate that the accuracies of the SVM classifiers are 99.81% for TEs, 99.93% for QBs and 99.62% for IEs. Our classification indicates that 37.57% of the seismic events are QBs occurring in possible mine areas and appearing mostly as clusters with a percentage of event daytime occurrence greater than 0.9, 50.12% are TEs occurring in various thrust faults in the Tianshan orogenic belt, and 12.31% are IEs or shallow tectonic earthquakes occurring mostly as clusters near oil and gas fields and water reservoirs. We reevaluate b values in the region and obtain relatively uniform values for the classified TEs with most of them below 1.0, as opposed to a large range of values (0.5‐2.7) when all the seismic events are used in the analysis.

We use a machine learning method employing support vector machine (SVM) to classify tectonic earthquakes (TEs), quarry blasts (QBs) and induced earthquakes (IEs) among 30,181 1.5 &lt; <i>M</i> <sub>L</sub> &lt;2.9 seismic events that occurred in the Tianshan orogenic belt in China from 2009 to 2017. SVM classifiers are derived based on discriminant features of a training dataset consisting of 1,400 TEs selected from the aftershock sequences of 18 <i>M</i> <sub>L</sub>≥5.0 earthquakes, 2,881 QBs from repeating events occurring in those areas with a percentage of event daytime occurrence greater than 0.9, and 987 IEs from events in the known oil/gas fields and water reservoirs. The discriminant features include spectral amplitudes of observed P and S wave signals in a frequency range of 1‐15 Hz normalized by the P spectrum and averaged over the entire seismic network, and an optional feature of the percentage of event daytime occurrence. Statistics analyses indicate that the accuracies of the SVM classifiers are 99.81% for TEs, 99.93% for QBs and 99.62% for IEs. Our classification indicates that 37.57% of the seismic events are QBs occurring in possible mine areas and appearing mostly as clusters with a percentage of event daytime occurrence greater than 0.9, 50.12% are TEs occurring in various thrust faults in the Tianshan orogenic belt, and 12.31% are IEs or shallow tectonic earthquakes occurring mostly as clusters near oil and gas fields and water reservoirs. We reevaluate b values in the region and obtain relatively uniform values for the classified TEs with most of them below 1.0, as opposed to a large range of values (0.5‐2.7) when all the seismic events are used in the analysis.</p>

Virtual Tide Gauges for Predicting Relative Sea Level Rise
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We present a Bayesian method to map contemporary rates of relative sea level change using a joint inversion of vertical trends from tide gauges, GPS time series, and satellite radar altimetry measurements. Tide gauge measurements constrain rates of relative sea level change on decadal to secular time scales at a few hundred sites sparsely distributed along coastlines. Predicting the rates of relative sea level change from historical tide gauge measurements is difficult due to the paucity and uneven distribution of sites with high quality records. Since the late twentieth century, deployments of GPS stations have enabled accurate determination of the rates of vertical land motion. A series of satellite radar altimetry missions provide continuous and global monitoring of geocentric sea level changes since the launch of TOPEX/Poseidon in 1992. By combining these three observations types into a single Bayesian inversion, we construct continuous maps of rates of relative sea level change, geocentric sea level change, and vertical land motion assuming linear trends, with robust estimates of uncertainties at regional scales. Cross‐validation tests show that reliable predictions of relative sea level changes are still provided where only GPS and satellite altimetry data are used, suggesting this method is viable for studying potential sea level risk for communities where historical tide gauge data are not available. Our results provide spatially and temporally consistent estimates of the various contributions to relative sea level changes.

Phase Equilibrium Condition for Pore Hydrate: Theoretical Formulation and Experimental Validation
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Based on the chemical potential equilibrium of water, a generalized equation of phase equilibrium is presented for pore hydrate, which relates the temperature depression of hydrate to the capillary pressure and osmotic pressure. The relationship between capillary pressure and unhydrated water content can be characterized by a soil‐water characteristic curve (SWCC). Uniting the SWCC and the phase equilibrium equation yields the equation of soil hydration characteristic curve (SHCC), which expresses the relationship between the unhydrated water content and temperature depression of pore hydrate. A series of experiments are performed, validating the phase equilibrium equation and the concept of SHCC. From the SHCC, the phase equilibrium surface can be determined in the space of temperature, pressure, and unhydrated water content. The thermodynamic state of pore hydrate moves on the equilibrium surface when the hydrate forms or dissociates. The projections of the equilibrium surface indicate the dissociation process of pore hydrate caused by thermal stimulation or depressurization. The salt solution changes the equilibrium surface to the direction that requires lower temperature and higher pressure and slows down the dissociation rates of hydrate to temperature and pressure.

Experimental Investigation of the Dynamics of Trapped Nonwetting Droplets Subjected to Seismic Stimulation in Constricted Tubes
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Multiphase fluid flow in porous media can be affected by the dynamic stressing caused by earthquakes or human‐made blasts. Changes in the permeability of porous media can be induced by the mobilization of trapped colloids, immiscible droplets, or bubbles due to such dynamic stressing. In order to analyze the mechanism of this seismic‐induced mobilization, a theoretical fluid dynamics conceptual model had been developed to describe this phenomenon in constricted tubes. In the research presented in this paper, we made an experimental effort to obtain reliable data to study the dynamics of nonwetting droplets and validate the previous theoretical fluid dynamics conceptual model in constricted tubes. In our experiments, we considered not only the frequencies and acceleration amplitudes of the seismic stimulation but also different initial positions of the nonwetting droplets, aspect ratios of the constricted tubes, and viscosities of nonwetting phases. We used a high‐speed camera to capture video of the mobilization process of droplets inside capillary tubes, and then manually tracked the displacement of the droplets. Our experimental observation revealed a strong dependence on the critical acceleration amplitude for mobilization on the initial position of a droplet's front menisci. Finally, the reliability of the theoretical model was validated against the experimental data on amplitude amplifications in oscillation experiments and critical amplitudes in mobilization experiments, as dependent on the frequency.

Rheological Controls on Asperity Weakening During Earthquake Slip
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Evolution of fault strength during the initial stages of seismic slip plays an important role in the onset of velocity‐induced weakening, which in turn, leads to larger earthquake events. A key dynamic weakening mechanism during the early stages of slip is flash heating, where stress concentrations at contacts on the interface lead to the rapid generation of heat. Although potential weakening from flash heating has been extensively modeled, there is little recorded microstructural evidence of its physical manifestations. We present results of a series of triaxial experiments on synthetic faults in quartz sandstone. Samples were subjected to a variety of normal stresses and ambient temperatures, to induce a range of slip event sizes and sliding velocities. We show the microstructural evolution of asperity interactions from the onset of flash heating through to the formation of grain‐scale areas of sheared melt. Using microstructural observations and mechanical data from the experiments, we model temperature and the viscoelastic behavior of the glass. Results suggest that, in the earliest stages of slip asperity contacts melt, but temperatures remain too low for viscous shear to occur within the melt layer. Instead melted asperities behave as glassy solids, facilitating continued frictional heating. With further slip, increased asperity temperatures allow the transition to viscous shear within the melt layer, facilitating weakening. These results highlight the dynamic evolution of the viscoelastic properties of the melt and resulting effects on asperity strength. Such complexity has, to‐date, not been fully addressed in modeling of flash heating.

Imaging and monitoring temporal changes of shallow seismic velocities at the Garner Valley near Anza, California, following the M7.2 2010 El Mayor‐Cucapah earthquake
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Seismograms from ~700 local earthquakes recorded at various depths (0 m, 6 m, 15 m, 22 m, 50 m, and 150 m) by sensors of the Garner Valley Downhole Array (GVDA) in southern California are used to analyze the shallow velocity structure and temporal changes of seismic velocities after the 2010 M7.2 El Mayor‐Cucapah (EMC) earthquake. The direct P‐ and S‐wave travel times between surface and borehole stations reveal very low shear wave velocities (178‐259 m/s) and very high Vp/Vs ratios (6.2) in the top 22 m. Temporal changes of seismic velocities after the EMC earthquake are estimated using autocorrelations of data in moving time windows at two borehole stations (22 m and 50 m) and seismic interferometry between multiple station pairs of the GVDA. The S‐wave velocity in the top 6 m drops abruptly by 14.3±3.3%, during the passage of surface waves from the EMC event with a peak ground acceleration of 39 Gal, and recovers in ~236 sec. The average velocity reductions decrease with depth and are 10.9±3.1%, 8.5±2.1%, 6.3±2.1%, and 4.5±2.0% in the top 15 m, 22 m, 50 m, and 150 m, respectively. Comparisons of seismic interferometry results between sensor pairs at 0‐22 m and 22‐150 m indicate that statistically significant velocity changes are limited at the site to the top 22 m. Pore pressure data are in phase with the surface displacement and reach maxima when the highest velocity drop occurs, suggesting fluid effects contribute to the observed velocity reductions.

Shallow Megathrust Slip During Large Earthquakes That Have High P Coda Levels
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Determining the up‐dip extent of slip during large megathrust earthquakes is important for understanding tsunami generation, potential for subsequent failure of the shallow megathrust, and plate contact depth‐varying frictional properties. Recent measurements of early Pcoda amplitudes relative to direct P signals for the period range 7 to 15 s find high Pcoda/P ratios for many events with finite‐fault rupture models that have slip extending to near deep trenches, resulting in enhanced pwP (water‐reverberation) generation. However, some events with high Pcoda/P measures have finite‐fault model solutions that vary in, or lack, shallow slip. We re‐examine six large megathrust earthquakes with unexplained high Pcoda/P ratios (30 July 1995 Chile, MW 8.0; 17 November 2003 Aleutian, MW 7.7; 12 November 1996 Peru, MW 7.7; 7 October 2009 Vanuatu, MW 7.6; 5 May 2015 Papua New Guinea, MW 7.5; 5 March 2002 Mindanao, MW 7.5), inverting for slip models with depth‐varying dip and varying bathymetry, adjusting kinematic parameters to better allow for the possibility of late shallow slip with associated strong pwP excitation. We confirm that modest patchy late shallow slip (~1 to 3 m) occurred near the trench for the 1995 and 2003 events, accounting for observed high Pcoda levels and minor tsunamis. The 2009 event appears to have minor shallow slip, whereas the 1996, 2002 and 2015 events do not; their coda amplitudes are likely enhanced by early aftershocks. Refined modeling of the later stages of large megathrust ruptures, guided by Pcoda levels, improves resolution of the up‐dip limit of co‐seismic slip.

Diurnal and Semidiurnal P‐ and S‐wave Velocity Changes Measured Using an Airgun Source
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Monitoring the subtle seismic velocity changes provides a promising tool to study the Earth's dynamic processes. However, the precise monitoring of seismic velocity with high temporal resolution is still challenging especially at large distances. Here, we continuously monitor P‐wave and S‐wave velocities with a precision of up to 10−5 using an airgun source. During a one‐week experiment conducted in the Yunnan Province, Southwestern China, unambiguous diurnal and semidiurnal velocity changes with amplitudes of ~10−4–10−3 were observed for both P‐ and S‐waves at distances up to 21 km. The amplitudes of P‐wave velocity (Vp) change are 1.2 to 3.8 times the amplitudes of S‐wave velocity (Vs) changes. The velocity variation decreases with the increase in distance and is larger in the basin region than that in the mountainous region. Seismic velocities change show less correlation with volumetric tide strain but strong correlation with changes of air temperature and air pressure. We propose that the thermal strains from air temperature changes are the primary cause of the observed diurnal and semidiurnal seismic velocity changes. The stronger Vp than Vs change is explained by the higher Vp sensitivity to the saturation rate. The velocity changes in mountainous area are ascribed mainly to the crack density changes, while both crack density change and saturation change are required to account for the velocity changes in the basin.

During a one‐week experiment conducted in the Yunnan Province, Southwestern China, unambiguous diurnal and semidiurnal velocity changes with amplitudes of ~10<sup>−4</sup>–10<sup>−3</sup> were observed for both P‐ and S‐waves at distances up to 21 km. The amplitudes of P‐wave velocity (Vp) change are 1.2 to 3.8 times the amplitudes of S‐wave velocity (Vs) changes. The velocity variation decreases with the increase in distance and is larger in the basin region than that in the mountainous region. Seismic velocities change show less correlation with volumetric tide strain but strong correlation with changes of air temperature and air pressure. We propose that the thermal strains from air temperature changes are the primary cause of the observed diurnal and semidiurnal seismic velocity changes. The stronger Vp than Vs change is explained by the higher Vp sensitivity to the saturation rate. The velocity changes in mountainous area are ascribed mainly to the crack density changes, while both crack density change and saturation change are required to account for the velocity changes in the basin.</p>

Seismogenic necking during slab detachment, evidence from relocation of intermediate depth seismicity in the Alboran slab
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract With few exceptions, intermediate‐depth seismicity is associated with active subduction. In the Alboran slab that is located just east of the Gibraltar Strait in the westernmost Mediterranean, although evidence suggests subduction is no longer active, tens to hundreds of M<5.0 earthquakes are observed every year at depths of ~80 km. In this paper, we relocate 58 such events recorded by the PICASSO temporary network using a 3D velocity model and implementing a grid‐search approach to minimize the normalized misfit between observed and predicted P and S‐wave arrival times. Meanwhile relocate 908 events recorded by the Spanish national network using double‐difference method and give a high‐precision picture of seismicity distribution within the slab. Relocation results reveal five clusters in this region separated by small gaps. Jointly considering relocation results and a 3D tomography model indicates one cluster is at a shallower depth above the northern, E‐W oriented arm of the Alboran slab, while the other four are aligned from north to south, parallel to the strike of the slab and near its core. Larger events are generally shallower and more scattered, while the deeper, more clustered events tend to have smaller magnitudes. Clusters further to the north show concentrated seismicity on narrow zones that dip ~45° to the south. We suggest this seismicity is associated with active necking and breakoff of the Alboran slab, which is progressing from north to south. Shear instability is likely to be the failure‐enabling mechanism for the occurrence of these earthquakes.

Intergranular Clay Films Control Inelastic Deformation in the Groningen Gas Reservoir: Evidence From Split‐Cylinder Deformation Tests
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Production of oil and gas from sandstone reservoirs leads to small elastic and inelastic strains in the reservoir, which may induce surface subsidence and seismicity. While the elastic component is easily described, the inelastic component, and any rate‐sensitivity thereof remain poorly understood in the relevant small strain range (≤1.0%). To address this, we performed a sequence of five stress/strain‐cycling plus strain‐marker‐imaging experiments on a single split‐cylinder sample (porosity 20.4%) of Slochteren sandstone from the seismogenic Groningen gas field. The tests were performed under in situ conditions of effective confining pressure (40 MPa) and temperature (100 °C), exploring increasingly large differential stresses (up to 75 MPa) and/or axial strains (up to 4.8%) in consecutive runs. At the small strains relevant to producing reservoirs (≤1.0%), inelastic deformation was largely accommodated by deformation of clay‐filled grain contacts. High axial strains (>1.4%) led to pervasive intragranular cracking plus intergranular slip within localized, conjugate bands. Using a simplified sandstone model, we show that the magnitude of inelastic deformation produced in our experiments at small strains (≤1.0%) and stresses relevant to the Groningen reservoir can indeed be roughly accounted for by clay film deformation. Thus, inelastic compaction of the Groningen reservoir is expected to be largely governed by clay film deformation. Compaction by this mechanism is shown to be rate insensitive on production timescales and is anticipated to halt when gas production stops. However, creep by other processes cannot be eliminated. Similar, clay‐bearing sandstone reservoirs occur widespread globally, implying a wide relevance of our results.

Uplift of Trail Ridge, Florida, by Karst Dissolution, Glacial Isostatic Adjustment, and Dynamic Topography
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The present elevation of Trail Ridge, a purported Pleistocene paleoshoreline (2.21 ± 0.38 Ma) up to ~70 m high, is attributed to isostatic uplift from karst‐induced mass loss of the underlying Florida Platform. However, glacial isostatic adjustment, dynamic topography (DT), and elastic flexure also contribute to the observed topography. We investigated the combined contribution of these geophysical processes to the elevation of Trail Ridge by adapting a numerical model of karst‐induced Airy isostatic uplift that is driven by sea level change since ~3 Ma with a gravitationally self‐consistent glacial isostatic adjustment model. We treat DT as a free parameter and explore a spectrum of scenarios, from dynamic subsidence (−25 m/Myr) to dynamic uplift (+25 m/Myr), with values consistent with mantle convection simulations for the region. We demonstrate a trade‐off between the age of Trail Ridge, karstification efficiency, and DT rate that necessitates robust estimates of two of these variables when solving for the third. For example, adopting spring‐efflux‐derived estimates of subsurface carbonate dissolution (1 m/38,000 yr) and a 10 m/Myr dynamic topographic uplift for the northern Florida Platform predicts an age of ~2.1 Ma for a model 70 m elevation marker, consistent with the bounds of the electron spin resonance optical dating geochronology. In contrast, by assuming a more rapid carbonate dissolution efficiency (1 m/11,000 yr) and dynamic subsidence of −15 m/Myr predicts a similar age. A refined karst‐induced isostatic uplift model age for Trail Ridge requires both improved rates of regional karst dissolution, dynamic topographic change, and elastic flexure.

Effects of Kerogen Content on Elastic Properties‐Based on Artificial Organic‐Rich Shale (AORS)
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Quantitative rock physical approaches are becoming increasingly important for both geophysical exploration and geological interpretation. One limiting factor is that experimental measurements in natural rock tend to be restricted by the availability of natural materials particularly if they are obtained from core holes. Artificial physical models that allow for control of composition and structure provide opportunities to carry out many more experiments on a range of samples with different characteristics. In this study, a hot‐pressing technique that includes temperature and pressure control is developed to construct artificial organic‐rich shales (AORS). The compositions of the AORS were developed from known natural samples and include mixtures of relevant minerals and appropriate organic matter considering grain sizes and shapes. The microstructures of the samples as observed in the scanning electron microscope and the petrophysical properties (density, porosity, permeability, and pressure sensitivity) are similar to those observed in the natural shales and support use of these samples as shale analogs. A total of 10 AORS samples with kerogen contents (KC) ranging from 1.71% to 14.8% was constructed to evaluate the effects of KC on elastic properties. A cross‐plot of the VP/VSH ratio versus the acoustic impedance indicates patterns that may be useful in remotely assessing KC content. Similarly, cross‐plots using the Lamé parameters of λρ versus μρ at various confining pressure may also be an effective tool in predicting KC. The linear correlations between the sum of weight percentage of KC and porosity and acoustic impedance tend to be strengthened during the pressurized procedure.

The 2013 and 2017 Ms 5 Seismic Swarms in Jilin, NEChina: Fluid‐Triggered Earthquakes?
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Understanding the mechanism of moderate earthquake swarm is important for the time‐dependent hazard assessment. Five Ms ≥ 5.0 earthquakes occurred between October and November 2013 in Qianguo, Jilin, a region with low seismicity in northeast China. After 4 years, two more Ms > 5.0 earthquakes struck Ningjiang, Jilin. To investigate the swarm mechanism and the relationship between these two swarm activities, we determine the full moment tensor solutions for 12 Ms > 3.5 earthquakes, including the seven Ms ≥ 5.0 events. The focal mechanisms show that the 2013 Ms ≥ 5.0 events mostly exhibit thrust compression with significant volume closure components, whereas the 2017 Ms ≥ 5.0 earthquakes illustrate a dominated strike‐slip type. In order to explain such differences, we conduct double‐difference tomography in the study region. Our tomographic results reveal that both swarms are located in the low‐velocity zones and the fault materials exhibit structural variations along the strike, possibly indicating that the structural contrast could be critical for the variations in the focal mechanism and hypocenter migration. The faults provide pathways for the upward intrusion of fluids that control the distribution and migration of the swarm sequences. A long‐term fluid‐rock interaction could lead to the fault materials intensely fractured in the 2013 swarm area but relatively less damaged in the 2017 swarm area. We can conclude that fluids play an important role in triggering the two seismic swarms.

Deep Low‐Frequency Earthquakes Associated With the Eruptions of Shinmoe‐dake in KirishimaVolcanoes
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Deep low‐frequency (DLF) earthquakes occur beneath the Kirishima volcanoes in southwest Japan at depths of 10–30 km. In this study, we aim to reveal the relationship between DLF earthquakes and volcanic activity including eruptions by relocating the hypocenters of the earthquakes using the network correlation coefficient method and detecting the earthquakes comprehensively using the matched filter technique. Hypocenters of DLF earthquakes are found to be concentrated in some separated small clusters within depths of 10–15 and 20–27 km. Activation of deeper DLF earthquakes had been observed for approximately 2 years from December 2009, during which various styles of eruptions occurred. Such a 2‐year increase in DLF seismicity was well correlated with crustal deformation because of the volume change of a magma reservoir. The waveforms and hypocenters of DLF earthquakes during the activation period were different from those during other time periods. The activated DLF earthquakes mostly had low dominant frequencies and were located in four deeper clusters. The activation of each cluster was switched 3 times at the transition of the eruption styles. These results suggest that DLF earthquakes might occur near magma sills and could be triggered by fluid flow in the changing paths by complex eruption processes. In addition, the waveforms and hypocenters of DLF earthquakes associated with the 2018 eruptions are different from those associated with the 2011 eruptions. The fluid paths of the 2018 eruptions might be different from those of the 2011 eruptions.

An In‐Depth Seismological Analysis Revealing a Causal Link Between the 2017 MW 5.5 Pohang Earthquake and EGS Project
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Hydraulic injection by the Pohang enhanced geothermal systems (EGSs) has been suspected to trigger the 2017 moment magnitude (MW) 5.5 Pohang earthquake in South Korea. The last stimulation experiment in the EGS was conducted only 2 months before the disaster, which has led to this suspicion. In this study, we conducted a seismic analysis on the earthquakes that have occurred around the EGS site in the past 10 years. The study included the construction of a velocity model, earthquake detection, the determination of hypocenters, magnitudes, focal mechanisms, and stress inversion, and a clustering analysis. No seismic activity was detected near the study area until November 2015 when there was a loss of a large quantity of heavy drilling mud. For three stimulations of a geothermal well, earthquakes sequentially migrated to the southwest along a fault plane, leading to the location of the mainshock. The delineated fault plane crossed the injection well at approximately 3,800 m, which corresponds to the borehole interval of not only the mud loss but also the breakage of the well's casing due to the mainshock rupture. These findings can be treated as empirical evidence for the hypothesis that the 2017 MW 5.5 Pohang earthquake was initiated on a critically stressed fault zone by the anthropogenic activity of fluid injection, consequentially releasing accumulated strain energy via tectonic loading.

<h2>Abstract</h2> <p>Hydraulic injection by the Pohang enhanced geothermal systems (EGSs) has been suspected to trigger the 2017 moment magnitude (M<sub>W</sub>) 5.5 Pohang earthquake in South Korea. The last stimulation experiment in the EGS was conducted only 2 months before the disaster, which has led to this suspicion. In this study, we conducted a seismic analysis on the earthquakes that have occurred around the EGS site in the past 10 years. The study included the construction of a velocity model, earthquake detection, the determination of hypocenters, magnitudes, focal mechanisms, and stress inversion, and a clustering analysis. No seismic activity was detected near the study area until November 2015 when there was a loss of a large quantity of heavy drilling mud. For three stimulations of a geothermal well, earthquakes sequentially migrated to the southwest along a fault plane, leading to the location of the mainshock. The delineated fault plane crossed the injection well at approximately 3,800 m, which corresponds to the borehole interval of not only the mud loss but also the breakage of the well's casing due to the mainshock rupture. These findings can be treated as empirical evidence for the hypothesis that the 2017 M<sub>W</sub> 5.5 Pohang earthquake was initiated on a critically stressed fault zone by the anthropogenic activity of fluid injection, consequentially releasing accumulated strain energy via tectonic loading.</p>

Modeling the Seismic Response of Unstable Rock Mass With Deep Compliant Fractures
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract An experimental quantification of the strength and volume of real, heterogeneous, fractured rock masses is crucial when assessing rock slope stability. In order to quantitatively characterize the internal structure of fractured rock slopes, we present three‐dimensional numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation and compare with observations. We introduce a simple, effective model for fractured rock mass, which can easily be applied to simulate weak‐motion seismic wave propagation. The macroscopic compliant fractures cutting the rock mass are modeled as finite‐width zones of reduced elastic parameters characterized by shear and normal stiffness. The widths of such zones are not fixed and can be adjusted to fit the grid step in the numerical method. The proposed rock mass model is applied and tested for the Walkerschmatt site in southwest Switzerland. Synthetic ambient vibrations are generated using a finite‐difference method for the fractured rock mass, shaped by the real terrain geometry, and compared with the measurements. The observed seismic response is satisfactorily reproduced in a broad frequency range (0.5–10 Hz). The synthetized response is primarily controlled by the stiffness, depth, number of fractures, and inertial mass of the fractured rock. The simulated amplification and ground‐motion directionality correspond with the observed levels, unless (1) the simplified cracks reach depths of 200–300 m; and (2) the fracture network is larger with respect to the mapped network. This illustrates the potential of ambient vibration methods in combination with numerical simulations to infer depth, volume, and mechanical characteristics of slope instability.

Dynamic Accretion Beneath a Slow‐Spreading Ridge Segment: IODP Hole 1473A and the Atlantis Bank Oceanic Core Complex
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract 809 deep IODP Hole U1473A at Atlantis Bank, SWIR, is 2.2 km from 1,508‐m Hole 735B and 1.4 from 158‐m Hole 1105A. With mapping, it provides the first 3‐D view of the upper levels of a 660‐km2 lower crustal batholith. It is laterally and vertically zoned, representing a complex interplay of cyclic intrusion, and ongoing deformation, with kilometer‐scale upward and lateral migration of interstial melt. Transform wall dives over the gabbro‐peridotite contact found only evolved gabbro intruded directly into the mantle near the transform. There was no high‐level melt lens, rather the gabbros crystallized at depth, and then emplaced into the zone of diking by diapiric rise of a crystal mush followed by crystal‐plastic deformation and faulting. The residues to mass balance the crust to a parent melt composition lie at depth below the center of the massif—likely near the crust‐mantle boundary. Thus, basalts erupted to the seafloor from >1,550 mbsf. By contrast, the Mid‐Atlantic Ridge lower crust drilled at 23°N and at Atlantis Massif experienced little high‐temperature deformation and limited late‐stage melt transport. They contain primitive cumulates and represent direct intrusion, storage, and crystallization of parental MORB in thinner crust below the dike‐gabbro transition. The strong asymmetric spreading of the SWIR to the south was due to fault capture, with the northern rift valley wall faults cutoff by a detachment fault that extended across most of the zone of intrusion. This caused rapid migration of the plate boundary to the north, while the large majority of the lower crust to spread south unroofing Atlantis Bank and uplifting it into the rift mountains.

<title>Induced seismicity in the Delaware Basin, Texas</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The seismicity rate in the Delaware Basin, located in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico, has increased by orders of magnitude within the past ~5 years. While no seismicity was reported in the southern Delaware Basin during 1980‐2014, 37 earthquakes with M > 3 occurred in this area during 2015‐2018. We generated an improved catalog of ~37,000 earthquakes in this region during 2009‐2018 by applying multi‐station template matching at both regional and local stations using all earthquakes in the ANSS and TexNet catalogs. We found that the vast majority of the seismicity is most likely associated with wastewater disposal, while at least ~5% of the seismicity was induced directly by hydraulic fracturing. We inferred far‐field effects of wastewater disposal inducing earthquakes over distances >25 km. The spatial limits of seismicity correlate with geologic structures that include the Central Platform and Grisham Fault, suggesting hydrologic compartmentalization by low‐permeability boundaries. Given that the seismicity rate increased throughout the duration of the study, if industry operations continue unaltered it is likely that both the seismicity rate and number of M > 3 earthquakes may continue to increase in the future.

Simulation of Remanent, Transient, and Induced FORC Diagrams for Interacting Particles With Uniaxial, Cubic, and Hexagonal Anisotropy
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The diagnostic power of first‐order reversal curve (FORC) diagrams has recently been enhanced by an extended measurement protocol that yields three additional FORC‐like diagrams: the remanent (remFORC), induced (iFORC), and transient (tFORC) diagrams. Here, we present micromagnetic simulations using this extended protocol, including numerical predictions of remFORC, iFORC, and tFORC signatures for particle ensembles relevant to rock magnetism. Simulations are presented for randomly packed single‐domain (SD) particles with uniaxial, cubic, and hexagonal anisotropy, and for chains of uniaxial SD particles. Noninteracting particles have zero tFORC, but distinct remFORC and iFORC signals, that provide enhanced discrimination between uniaxial, cubic, and hexagonal anisotropy types. Increasing interactions lessen the ability to discriminate between uniaxial and cubic anisotropy but reproduces a change in the pattern of positive and negative iFORC signals observed for SD‐dominated versus vortex‐dominated samples. Interactions in SD particles lead to the emergence of a bi‐lobate tFORC distribution, which is related to formation of flux‐closure in super‐vortex states. A predicted iFORC signal associated with collapsed chains is observed in experimental data and may aid magnetofossil identification in sediments. Asymmetric FORC and FORC‐like distributions for hexagonal anisotropy are explained by the availability of multiple easy axes within the basal plane. A transition to uniaxial switching occurs below a critical value of the out‐of‐plane/in‐plane anisotropy ratio, which may allow FORC diagrams to provide insight into the stress state of hexagonal minerals, such as hematite.

Magma Flow Rates and Temporal Evolution of the 2012–2014 Post‐Eruptive Intrusions at El Hierro, Canary Islands
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The 2011–2014 volcanic activity at El Hierro (Canary Islands) was characterized by a 5‐month long submarine eruption as well as a series of magmatic intrusions occurring between 5 months and 2 years after the eruption, as revealed by seismic swarms and ground deformation. We study the temporal evolution of the six post‐eruptive magmatic intrusions, using Global Navigation Satellite System and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar observations complemented with relocated earthquakes. Magma volumes and magma supply rates are determined from inversion of the geodetic data using a Bayesian approach. The intrusions last between ~3 and 20 days and are inferred to be sill‐like, thin compared with their lateral extent and emplaced in the ~13–16 km depth range. Initial magma flow rates of ~300 m3/s decay exponentially with time. The two largest intrusions occurred in June–July 2012 and March–April 2013. During each of these events, magma migrated laterally, and >120 ×106 m3 of magma was intruded beneath the island. The shortest events, <1 week‐long, intruded ~(24hyphen;44) ×106 m3 of magma beneath the volcano. We suggest that all intrusions originated from an overpressure in a deep magma body located beneath the center of El Hierro. The crust/mantle boundary and the previous intrusion that fed the 2011–2012 submarine eruption may have discouraged the ascent of the post‐eruptive intrusions to the surface and forced them to migrate laterally away from the island as sill‐like sources.

High Pressure‐Temperature Study on the Thermal Equations of State of Seifertite andCaCl2‐Type SiO2
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract In this study, we have determined the thermal equations of state (EoS) of CaCl2‐type SiO2 and seifertite (α‐PbO2‐type SiO2) from 55 to 147 GPa up to 3500 K using X‐ray diffraction in laser‐heated diamond anvil cells. The phase transition from stishovite to CaCl2‐type SiO2 is in good agreement with previous experimental results, whereas the transition from CaCl2‐type SiO2 to seifertite was observed to strongly rely on the starting material. For CaCl2‐type SiO2, we obtained a bulk modulus, KT0 = 245(7) GPa with a fixed KT′ = 4, V0 = 48.1(2) Å3, γ0 = 1.3(3), q = 1(fixed), and θD0 = 1100(400) K. Seifertite has a greater KT0 = 290(10) GPa (KT′ = 4 fixed) than CaCl2‐type SiO2. Other thermoelastic parameters of seifertite are V0 = 92.3(5) Å3, γ0 = 1.6(2), q = 1 (fixed), and θD0 = 1600(200) K. Using the obtained results and phase boundary in previous studies, we have found that the phase transition from stishovite to CaCl2‐type SiO2 cannot cause a noticeable change in density but can lower the bulk sound velocity (VФ) by ~10%. This phase transition in the subducted oceanic crust with 20 vol.% SiO2 was estimated to generate a ~2% discontinuity in VФ, which could be related to the observed seismic velocity anomalies at depths of 1,400–1,800 km. At the bottom of the lower mantle, CaCl2‐type SiO2 to seifertite phase transition can lead to a 0.3% jump in ρ and a 0.8% jump in VΦ considering 20 vol.% SiO2 in the subducted mid‐ocean ridge basalt, which may contribute to the formation of the D″ discontinuity above the core‐mantle boundary.

Geochemical Evidence for Hydration and Dehydration of Crustal Rocks During Continental Rifting
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract To understand the temporal sequence of geological processes such as magmatism, water‐rock interaction, and metamorphism in fossil continental rifts, a combined study of petrography, mineral geochemistry, in situ garnet O isotopes, in situ zircon U‐Pb ages and O isotopes, and pseudosection calculations was conducted for metagranites from a Neoproterozoic continental rift generated during the Rodinia breakup. The results provide insights into the operation of hydration and dehydration during continental rifting. In the metagranites from the northern margin of South China, three types of garnet (Garnet‐I to ‐III) are distinguished. They were sequentially produced by hydrothermal alteration, metamorphic dehydration, and fluid metasomatism. All of these garnets show negative δ18O values of −19.3‰ to −14.5‰, in contrast to mantle‐like δ18O values for magmatic zircon. The extremely negative δ18O values of hydrothermal Garnet‐I require infiltration of the continental deglacial meltwater during the continental rifting, and before that zircon crystallized from normal δ18O magmas. Once the rocks were hydrothermally altered, the extreme 18O depletion was retained in all later products such as metamorphic Garnet‐II and metasomatic Garnet‐III. Pseudosection calculations indicate that the metamorphic dehydration occurred at 1.0–3.0 kbar and 630–690 °C during a reheating stage, corresponding to high thermal gradients of >60 °C/km. The high‐temperature/low‐pressure metamorphic rocks produced by such high thermal gradients are indicative of the continental rift setting. The mineral geochemistry records not only the temporal sequence of rift magmatism, water‐rock interaction, and rift metamorphism but also the evolution of temperature and water action in the crust during the continental rifting.

<title>Quantifying the Similarity of Paleomagnetic Poles</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract An ability to compare paleomagnetic poles quantitatively is fundamental to paleogeographic reconstruction. The Fisher distribution provides a statistical framework for both constructing and relating paleomagnetic poles to enable comparison of estimated pole positions in paleomagnetic reconstructions. However, Fisher distribution‐based confidence regions for paleomagnetic poles are often compared using empirical rules of thumb rather than by quantitative analysis of their full structure. Here we demonstrate potential shortcomings of such comparisons and propose continuous metrics for quantitative comparison of paleomagnetic poles. These metrics are simple to apply for Fisher distributions and can be modified readily for a broad range of alternative distributions that may be more appropriate for representing some paleomagnetic data sets. We demonstrate how our proposed metrics provide both quantitative and probabilistic approaches to common tasks in paleomagnetic reconstruction, such as comparing estimated mean pole positions with apparent polar wander paths.

A Joint Inversion for Three‐dimensional P and S Wave Velocity Structure and Earthquake Locations Beneath Axial Seamount
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Axial Seamount is a prominent volcano located at the intersection of the Juan de Fuca Ridge and the Cobb‐Eickelberg hot spot in the northeast Pacific Ocean that has erupted in 1998, 2011, and 2015. The 2015 eruption was recorded by a seven‐station seismic network in the southern part of the summit caldera that forms part of the Ocean Observatories Initiative Cabled Array. We utilize a data set of ~3,900 well‐recorded earthquakes from January 2015 to February 2017 and a three‐dimensional P wave velocity model obtained previously from active source data to conduct a joint inversion for three‐dimensional P and S wave velocities and hypocentral parameters. The resulting velocity models are used to relocate >76,000 earthquakes with ≥10 arrival times. The velocity models reveal a low‐velocity anomaly in the center of the southern caldera at depths less than ~2 km, which corresponds to the top of the magma chamber and is interpreted as a region that is intensely fractured by the cyclical deformation of the caldera. High velocities around the caldera rim are likely due to consolidated undeformed lava flows. Low VP/VS in the southern caldera is consistent with the presence of hydrothermal vapor. Low S wave velocities and high VP/VS in the northern caldera may indicate a region dominated by thin cracks caused by dike injection. The relocated earthquakes delineate outward‐dipping ring faults more clearly than previous studies and image a subvertical inward‐dipping fault within the network that connects to the east caldera wall and eruptive fissures.

Upscaling of Elastic Properties in Carbonates: A Modeling Approach Based on a Multiscale Geophysical Data Set
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Linking ultrasonic measurements made on samples, with sonic logs and seismic subsurface data, is a key challenge for the understanding of carbonate reservoirs. To deal with this problem, we investigate the elastic properties of dry lacustrine carbonates. At one study site, we perform a seismic refraction survey (100 Hz), as well as “sonic” (54 kHz) and ultrasonic (250 kHz) measurements directly on outcrop and ultrasonic measurements on samples (500 kHz). By comparing the median of each data set, we show that the P wave velocity decreases from laboratory to seismic scale. Nevertheless, the median of the sonic measurements acquired on outcrop surfaces seems to fit with the seismic data, meaning that sonic acquisition may be representative of seismic scale. To explain the variations due to upscaling, we relate the concept of representative elementary volume with the wavelength of each scale of study. Indeed, with upscaling, the wavelength varies from millimetric to pluri‐metric. This change of scale allows us to conclude that the behavior of P wave velocity is due to different geological features (matrix porosity, cracks, and fractures) related to the different wavelengths used. Based on effective medium theory, we quantify the pore aspect ratio at sample scale and the crack/fracture density at outcrop and seismic scales using a multiscale representative elementary volume concept. Results show that the matrix porosity that controls the ultrasonic P wave velocities is progressively lost with upscaling, implying that crack and fracture porosity impacts sonic and seismic P wave velocities, a result of paramount importance for seismic interpretation based on deterministic approaches.

High bulk and shear attenuation due to partial melt in the Tonga‐Lau back‐arc mantle
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Seismic attenuation measures energy loss during seismic wave propagation and quantifies the relaxation of rocks’ elastic moduli. Abundant seismic studies have observed shear attenuation, but few have quantified bulk attenuation (bulk modulus relaxation), and these studies controversially locate finite bulk attenuation in different parts of the Earth, from the asthenosphere to the inner core. Here we present conclusive evidence localizing bulk attenuation to a specific region of the uppermost mantle. By analyzing amplitude spectral decay of P and S waves from Tonga earthquakes recorded at local seismic stations, we observe unusually low QP/QS ratios (< 1.5) in the Tonga‐Lau mantle wedge. All seismic raypaths with significant path‐average bulk attenuation (Qκ–1 > 0.01 or Qκ < 100) are confined to the region immediately beneath the Lau back‐arc spreading centers west of the Tonga Arc. Tomography results show that the highest bulk attenuation (Qκ–1 = 0.037 ± 0.008 or Qκ = 27.0 ± 0.2) is about 75% of the in‐situ shear attenuation. The observed high bulk attenuation anomalies coincide with an inferred zone of partial melting, suggesting the causative mechanism involves either infinitesimal movement of melt through pores or changes in melt fraction in response to seismic waves.

An Earthquake Early Warning Method Based on Huygens Principle: Robust Ground Motion Prediction Using Various Localized Distance‐Attenuation Models
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract For the stable operation of earthquake early warning systems under complex earthquake scenarios such as large earthquakes with complicated rupture processes and multiple simultaneous events during intense aftershock activity, wavefield‐based ground motion prediction approaches that can predict shaking directly from the observed shaking, without source parameter characterization, have been proposed. These existing algorithms, however, have weak points, including the employment of inflexible wave propagation models and limited available lead times for sites that have a potential to obtain long lead times. To address these shortcomings, I developed the Approximation by Local Pseudo‐Hypocenter Attenuation (ALPHA) method, a new wavefield‐based algorithm that predicts ground motion by estimating the distance‐attenuation relation from direct observations of the ongoing wavefield in real time. For this estimation, ALPHA uses multiple point‐source models located below each observation station to simulate elementary wave propagation in accordance with Huygens principle. Application to the 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku‐Oki and 2016 M7.3 Kumamoto earthquakes and 21 additional earthquakes with M ≥ 7 showed that ALPHA stably calculated accurate ground motion predictions for those events and provided long lead times for sites with an intensity threshold on bedrock of three on the Japan Meteorological Agency scale (~IV–VI on the modified Mercalli intensity scale). These findings indicate that ALPHA would enable early warning systems to issue accurate warnings to wider areas at an early stage than existing algorithms.

New Evidence of ‘Anomalous’ Vertical Movements along the Hinterland of the Atlantic NW African Margin
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Low‐temperature thermochronology studies revealed major exhumation events affecting domains in the hinterland of the Central Atlantic margins, where Palaeozoic and/or Precambrian basement is exposed. Thus, domains traditionally assumed to be stable since at least the Variscan and juxtaposed to subsiding Meso‐Cenozoic basins, appear to be affected by km‐scale vertical movements during the Atlantic rifting and after the Early Jurassic breakup in the Central Atlantic. In this contribution, we investigate the extent and the magnitude of these motions along the NW African margin by presenting the first low‐temperature thermochronology data from west Mauritania. The analysed 22 samples were collected along the Mauritanides, a N‐S trending Variscan Belt separating the cratonic Taoudeni Basin in the east from the Atlantic coastal basin in the west. The obtained apatite fission track (AFT) ages range between 236 and 90 Ma, with mean track lengths between 11.22 and 12.81 μm and Dpar comprised between 1.6 and 2.1 μm. The uncorrected (U‐Th‐Sm)/He (AHe) ages vary between 261 and 33 Ma. Inverse thermal modelling of the AFT and AHe data indicates that the hinterland of the Mauritanian Atlantic margin experienced (i) burial between the Permian and the Late Triassic, (ii) km‐scale exhumation during Middle‐Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, (iii) burial during the Palaeogene–early Miocene, and (iv) exhumation between mid‐Miocene and present‐day. We argue that these vertical movements are primarily driven by the tectonic evolution of the Atlantic rift and the subsequent geodynamic evolution of the Central Atlantic Ocean and the African plate.

Deep Seated Density Anomalies Across the Iberia‐Africa Plate Boundary and Its Topographic Response
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The modes in which the lithosphere deforms during continental collision and the mechanisms involved are not well understood. While continental subduction and mantle delamination are often invoked in tectonophysical studies, these processes are difficult to be confirmed in more complex tectonic regions such as the Gibraltar Arc. We study the present‐day density and compositional structure of the lithosphere along a transect running from South Iberia to North Africa crossing the western Gibraltar Arc. This region is located in the westernmost continental segment of the African‐Eurasian plates, characterized by a diffuse transpressive plate boundary. An integrated and self‐consistent geophysical‐petrological methodology is used to model the lithosphere structure variations and the thermophysical properties of the upper mantle. The crustal structure is mainly constrained by seismic experiments and geological data, whereas the composition of the lithospheric mantle is constrained by xenolith data. The results show large lateral variations in the topography of the lithosphere‐asthenosphere boundary. We distinguish different chemical lithospheric mantle domains that reproduce the main trends of the geophysical observables and the modeled P and S wave seismic velocities. A sublithospheric body colder than the surrounding mantle is needed beneath the Betics‐Rif to adjust the measured potential fields. We link this body to the Iberian slab localized just to the east of the profile and having some effect on the geoid and Bouguer anomalies. Local isostasy allows explaining most of the topography, but an elastic thickness higher than 10 km is needed to explain local misfits between the Atlas and the Rif Mountains.

Strength of Laboratory Synthesized Hydrate‐Bearing Sands and Their Relationship to Natural Hydrate‐Bearing Sediments
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The strength of hydrate‐bearing sediments is an important input parameter for numerical simulations for evaluating the long‐term future gas production from these sediments and the risks associated with such activities on the environment. Studies on laboratory synthesized, and natural, hydrate‐bearing coarse‐grained soils exhibit similar behavior, where increasing hydrate saturation increases specimen strength and stiffness with the corresponding development of peak stress, postpeak strain softening and tendency for sample dilation, which is suppressed with increasing effective stress, although strength is increased. For synthesized specimens, hydrate growth at grain contacts leads to “cementing” behavior and the largest increase in strength, which is subdued when hydrate growth is prevented at these locations. Sample disturbance in natural samples lead to lower strength and stiffness compared to laboratory synthesized samples. Unconfined compression shear tests on natural samples highlight the strong “cementing” effect of gas hydrates on coarse‐grained soils. The strength of natural sediments appears strongly correlated with particle size and clay content, with smaller particle and increasing clay content reducing strength for a given hydrate saturation. The strength parameters, friction angle, and cohesion appear to depend on sample type. For synthesized specimens, friction angle was reasonably independent of hydrate saturation while cohesion increased in an exponential manner, with the largest increase occurring when hydrate growth is at particle contacts. In contrast, friction angle appeared to increase with a corresponding reduction in cohesion for natural hydrate‐bearing sediments. However, these observations may be related to sample disturbance and stress conditions under which the data were acquired.

Evidence of Overtone Interference in Fundamental‐Mode Rayleigh Wave Phase and Amplitude Measurements
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We present evidence that measurements of minor‐arc fundamental‐mode (FM) Rayleigh waves experience interference from major‐arc overtones, resulting in travel‐time and amplitude measurements oscillating along a ray path. The oscillations are present in synthetic seismograms generated in a 3‐D Earth model via SPECFEM3D_GLOBE and in a 1‐D Earth model by mode summation. The absence of oscillations in synthetics containing only the FM indicates that the oscillations originate from higher‐mode interference. This interference is present across multiple measurement techniques, including multi‐channel cross correlation, phase‐matched filtering, and cluster analysis. Experiments with 1‐D synthetics suggest that contamination from interference is largest at epicentral distances greater than around 120 degrees, where record sections of seismograms show the major‐arc overtones intersecting the minor‐arc FM Rayleigh wave. The short wavelength of the interference pattern means it is only observable with dense station spacing and high data quality, which may explain why it has not, to our knowledge, been previously recognized. We show the interference is visible in real data. Its overall impact on phase‐velocity maps is probably minor due to many measurements from shorter path lengths less prone to interference bias. However, phase‐velocity maps constructed only from measurements at epicentral distances prone to interference exhibit significant noise and poor agreement with maps from measurements that include all path lengths; the issue is especially problematic for approaches that use differential travel times between nearby stations. Accounting for interference may diminish noise in measurements and improve the accuracy of images of the upper mantle.

Multiphysics Modeling of a Brittle‐Ductile Lithosphere Part II ‐Semi‐Brittle, Semi‐Ductile Deformation and Damage Rheology
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The brittle‐ductile transition is a domain of finite extent characterized by high differential stress and where both brittle and ductile deformation are likely to occur. Understanding its depth location, extent and stability through time is of relevance for diverse applications including subduction dynamics, mantle‐surface interactions and, more recently, proper targeting of high‐enthalpy unconventional geothermal resources, where local thermal conditions may activate ductile creep at shallower depths than expected. In this contribution, we describe a thermodynamically‐consistent physical framework and its numerical implementation, therefore extending the formulation of the companion paper (Jacquey & Cacace, 2019b) to model thermo‐hydro‐mechanical coupled processes responsible for the occurrence of transitional semi‐brittle semi‐ductile behavior in porous rocks. We make use of a damage rheology to account for the macroscopic effects of microstructural processes leading to brittle‐like material weakening and of a rate‐dependent plastic model to account for ductile material behavior. Our formulation additionally considers the role of porosity and its evolution during loading in controlling the volumetric mechanical response of a stressed rock. By means of dedicated applications, we discuss how our damage poro‐visco‐elasto‐viscoplastic rheology can effectively reconcile the style of localized deformation under different confining pressure conditions as well as the bulk macroscopic material response as recorded by laboratory experiments under full triaxial conditions.

Multiphysics Modeling of a Brittle‐Ductile Lithosphere Part I ‐Explicit Visco‐Elasto‐Plastic Formulation and its Numerical Implementation
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The long‐term strength of the lithosphere is controlled by two different modes of deformation: a brittle‐like, effective pressure‐sensitive behavior at shallow crustal depth, which gradually transits to a thermally activated ductile flow rheology with increasing depths. All applications dealing with long‐term tectonics therefore share the necessity to describe in a consistent way the multiphysics coupling among the different deformation mechanisms controlling the bulk behavior of the lithosphere. We describe an efficient numerical implementation of a consistent visco‐elasto‐plastic rheology suitable to describe the first order aspects of continental rock masses. Different from typical long‐term geodynamics numerical frameworks, we explicitly account for both volumetric and deviatoric response of lithospheric rocks to applied loads. Plastic correction to a visco‐elastic stress state is introduced via a non‐associative Drucker‐Prager model, without resorting to the assumption of a plastic limiter. The transient behavior of crustal and lithospheric rocks is accounted for by an overstress (rate‐dependent) viscoplastic rheology, which additionally helps solving for numerical issues related to plastic strain accumulation even in the absence of energetic feedbacks. When applied to the study of the dynamics of plume‐lithosphere interactions, our implementation is able to reproduce a surface topography with complex multi‐harmonic wavelength patterns in agreement with observations. In the final chapter, we discuss main limitations of the current rheological description when applied to the study of transient semi brittle rock behavior. These aspects are tackled in a companion paper, where a thermodynamically consistent formulation extending the current numerical description is presented.

Stress transfer from opening hydraulic fractures controls the distribution of induced seismicity
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Understanding the dominant physical processes that cause fault reactivation due to fluid injection is vital to develop strategies to avoid and mitigate injection‐induced seismicity (IIS). IIS is a risk for several industries, including hydraulic fracturing, geothermal stimulation, oilfield waste disposal and carbon capture and storage, with hydraulic fracturing having been associated with some of the highest magnitude induced earthquakes (M > 5). As such, strict regulatory schemes have been implemented globally to limit the felt seismicity associated with operations. In the UK, a very strict ``traffic light” system is currently in place. These procedures were employed several times during injection at the PNR‐1z well at Preston New Road, Lancashire, UK from October to December 2018. As injection proceeded, it became apparent to the operator that stages were interacting with a seismogenic planar structure, interpreted as a fault zone, with several ML > 0.5 events occurring. Microseismicity was clustered along this planar structure in a fashion that could not readily be explained through pore pressure diffusion or hydraulic fracture growth. Instead, we investigate the role of static elastic stress transfer created by the tensile opening of hydraulic fractures. We find that the spatial distributions of microseismicity are strongly correlated with areas that receive positive Mohr‐Coulomb stress changes from the tensile fracture opening, while areas that receive negative Mohr‐Coulomb stress change are quiescent. We conclude that the stressing due to tensile hydraulic fracture opening plays a significant role in controlling the spatiotemporal distribution of induced seismicity.

Insights From Micromechanical Modeling of Intact Rock Failure: Event Characteristics, Stress Drops, and Force Networks
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We use a bonded‐particle method to investigate event characteristics, b values, internal force distributions, and stress drops in triaxial deformation tests. We simulate brittle through ductile deformation regimes. We find the following: (1) Event rates are proportional to anelastic axial strain: (i) significant and accelerating events rates only occur near peak stress (brittle deformation); (ii) event rates gradually increase until the anelastic strain plateaus (ductile deformation). (2) b value patterns show a systematic decrease when approaching peak stress, after which (i) they increase again (brittle case) or (ii) reach a constant minimum (ductile case). A decrease in b values is indicative of progressive internal damage, with an increasing event rate. (3) Weak‐ and strong‐force networks exist within the sample. Macrofailure of the sample occurs due to collapse of the strong‐force network. Acoustic emissions predominantly occur (i) within the weak‐force network allowing for tensile crack opening and closing despite the large compressive external stresses, and (ii) in areas with the largest spatial force gradients, close to the strong‐force networks. All internal compressive and extensional normal forces display exponential distributions despite uniform boundary stresses. (4) Stress drops of the largest events are inversely proportional to peak stress; the largest stress drops occur for brittle failure, progressively approaching a zero magnitude for ductile deformation. The systemic correlations between b values, the number of acoustic emissions, and stress drops with the maximum principal stress may offer opportunities to invert for changes in the stress state from these remote observables during earthquake cycles.

Quaternary Activity of the Beihewan Fault in the Southeastern Beishan Wrench Belt, Western China: Implications for Crustal Stability and Intraplate Earthquake Hazards North of Tibet
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We present evidence for the Late Quaternary activity of the Beihewan Fault (BHWF), along the southeastern margin of the Beishan block, western China. Field observations and analysis of UAV‐derived DEMs and Google Earth images reveal an ~10‐km‐long active fault trace in a region previously considered tectonically inactive. Offset landforms and trench exposures reveal that the fault is dominantly strike‐slip, with local thrust or normal displacements. Average rates of left‐lateral motion and thrusting since the Holocene are estimated to be ~2.69 and ~0.35 mm/a, respectively. The most recent surface‐rupturing event generated ~2.5 m of strike‐slip offset since 6.2–8.6 ka; with estimated M = 6.3–6.9. Modeling and two‐dimensional inversion of new magnetotelluric data indicate that the BHWF is a subvertical low‐resistivity zone that penetrates into the lower crust. Existing geological and geophysical evidence do not support subsurface linkage between the BHWF and Altyn Tagh–Jinta‐Nanshan Fault system further south in the Hexi Corridor. Close examination of high‐resolution satellite imagery west and east of the BHWF reveals other Quaternary surface fault scarps, pressure ridges, offset drainages, and truncated lithological strike belts. Collectively, these features constitute a previously unrecognized 150‐km‐long sinistral deforming belt along the southeastern Beishan and northern Hexi Corridor boundary that we call the Southeast Beishan Wrench Belt. Recognition of Quaternary activity along the BHWF within the larger Southeast Beishan Wrench Belt challenges long‐held assumptions that the Beishan region is a relatively stable and tectonically inactive block within the Late Cenozoic Indo‐Eurasian deformation field north of Tibet.

<h2>Abstract</h2> <p>We present evidence for the Late Quaternary activity of the Beihewan Fault (BHWF), along the southeastern margin of the Beishan block, western China. Field observations and analysis of UAV‐derived DEMs and Google Earth images reveal an ~10‐km‐long active fault trace in a region previously considered tectonically inactive. Offset landforms and trench exposures reveal that the fault is dominantly strike‐slip, with local thrust or normal displacements. Average rates of left‐lateral motion and thrusting since the Holocene are estimated to be ~2.69 and ~0.35 mm/a, respectively. The most recent surface‐rupturing event generated ~2.5 m of strike‐slip offset since 6.2–8.6 ka; with estimated <i>M</i> = 6.3–6.9. Modeling and two‐dimensional inversion of new magnetotelluric data indicate that the BHWF is a subvertical low‐resistivity zone that penetrates into the lower crust. Existing geological and geophysical evidence do not support subsurface linkage between the BHWF and Altyn Tagh–Jinta‐Nanshan Fault system further south in the Hexi Corridor. Close examination of high‐resolution satellite imagery west and east of the BHWF reveals other Quaternary surface fault scarps, pressure ridges, offset drainages, and truncated lithological strike belts.

Relative sea‐level changes over the past centuries in the central Ryukyu Arc inferred from coral microatolls
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract This study focuses on Okinawa and Yoron islands, in order to better understand tectonics in the Ryukyu Arc related to the subduction zone. We used coral microatolls known for their centimetric accuracy in the record of relative sea‐level (RSL) changes to reconstruct RSL changes over the last century from living microatolls. A fossil microatoll in Yoron was used to discuss possible RSL changes beyond the last century. The signal consists of emergence whose rate varies through time, interrupted by decadal to multidecadal periods of sudden and/or gradual submergence and by interannual sea‐level falls. Comparison with other existing RSL records in the arc highlights RSL variability along the arc. This pattern contrasts with the homogeneous and linear absolute regional sea‐level rise, implying that this latter signal cannot fully explain our observations and that an additional process is required. We suggest the subduction zone as a possible source for generating centimetric scale RSL changes observed in coral microatolls. We tested how the Ryukyu megathrust could explain our observations with elastic dislocation modeling. The emergence trend could be explained by interseismic loading on the plate interface with a minimum coupling rate of 25%, which is higher than previous estimates based on short instrumental records. As for the submergence events that occurred regularly in the coral record, we show that they could be explained by slow slip events on the shallower part of the megathrust or in the transition zone. Such process could accommodate a significant part of the total convergence.

Introduction to the Special Collection: Magnetism in the Geosciences—Advances and Perspectives
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Magnetic property research in the geosciences has seen an enormous development during the most recent decade. The underlying special collection published in two AGU journals: Journal of Geophysical Research—Solid Earth and Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems is an outcome of the 11th International Conference on Rock Magnetism, held in Utrecht (The Netherlands) in July 2017 and reflects this full breadth. We recognize four groups in which individual contributions are gathered. (1) Recent advances in fundamental rock and mineral magnetic methods, including discussions on how to assess magnetic grain size, which is centrally important to magnetic stability over geologic timescales and high‐fidelity paleomagnetic recording. (2) Geomagnetism with an emphasis on late Pleistocene paleosecular variation and relative paleointensity records, relevant to geomagnetic field models. (3) Reassessments of classic paleomagnetic field tests and examples of tectonic and magnetostratigraphic applications. (4) The merit of magnetic property analysis in solving geoscience problems, both in soft and hard rocks.

Zinc Isotope Constraints on Recycled Oceanic Crust in the Mantle Sources of the Emeishan Large Igneous Province
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Identification of the nature of recycling crustal materials in the sources of large igneous provinces (LIPs) is crucial for understanding compositional heterogeneity of the deep mantle. To provide new constraints on this issue, here we reported high‐precision zinc isotope data on picritic and basaltic lavas from the Emeishan LIP, SW China. Using olivine‐melt Mg‐Fe equilibrium and log (incompatible elements)‐log (MgO) systematics, the parental magma of picritic lavas is estimated to have a MgO content of 21.8 wt.%. All picrites and basalts analyzed have δ66ZnJMC 3‐0749L values of ~0.30‰, which is heavier by ~0.14‰ than that of the terrestrial mantle (0.16 ± 0.05‰, 2s.d.). Olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts in picrites are isotopically lighter by ~0.15‰ than the whole rocks, and a negative correlation between Zn and MgO contents for picrites is observed, indicating that olivine accumulation could lower Zn contents and δ66Zn values of the magmas. Taking this into account, the parental magma of picrites has a δ66Zn value of 0.33 ± 0.04‰ (2s.d.). This value is significantly higher than that of other large‐degree partial melts derived from the mantle (e.g. Archean komatiites and the Baffin Island picrites; ~0.20‰), which requires addition of recycled crustal materials into the mantle sources. Modeling suggests that this difference can be best explained by partial melting of a hybridized mantle source containing ~15% recycled basaltic oceanic crust. Our data also show no evidence for recycled marine carbonates into the source of Emeishan LIP and thus possibly into the Earth's deep mantle (>660 km).

Constraining the Intracontinental Tectonics of the SW Central Asian Orogenic Belt by the Early Permian Paleomagnetic Pole for the Turfan‐Hami Block
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract In order to better understand the kinematics and geodynamics of the late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic transition from accretionary to intracontinental tectonics in the southwest Central Asian Orogenic Belt, we performed a paleomagnetic study on Lower Permian strata in the Turpan‐Hami Basin, NW China. Magnetite and hematite are shown to be the principal magnetic remanence carriers. A typical sedimentary fabric that has not been modified by postdepositional deformation is recognized via magnetic fabric study. Stable characteristic remanent magnetizations, all of reverse magnetic polarity, are revealed by step demagnetizations. Remanence age is determined to be of Early Permian affinity, based on a fold test, remanence behavior of minerals, and geochronologic data. With inclination shallowing corrections, the first Early Permian paleomagnetic pole for the Turpan‐Hami Block is acquired as λ = 75.7°N, φ = 276.3°E, A95 = 5.7°, and N = 10 sites. Comparisons of this new pole with published ones from neighboring cratonic blocks provide kinematic constraints on the tectonic transition and subsequent intracontinental tectonics of this region. The Turpan‐Hami and Yili blocks have kept their relative positions since the Early Permian. Significant latitudinal movement of 14.7° ± 7.2° occurred between the Turpan‐Hami and South Junggar blocks and could be mainly accommodated by late Paleozoic crustal shortening of at least ~530 km across an intra‐arc basin in the Bogda belt. The Turpan‐Hami Block has experienced large‐magnitude relative rotations of −41.1° ± 7.1° and 21.2° ± 9.4° with respect to Tarim and South Junggar since the Early Permian, respectively, corresponding to dominant intracontinental tectonics characterized by large‐magnitude strike‐slip displacements along megashear zones.

Total Variation Regularization of Geodetically Constrained Block Models in Southwest Taiwan
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Rapid convergence between the Eurasian plate and the Philippine Sea Plate makes Taiwan one of the most active tectonic regions in the world, and this strain is accommodated on a complex network of thrust and strike‐slip faulting. Here, we use ascending and descending Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data integrated with continuous GPS measurements to monitor interseismic deformation in southwest Taiwan. Geodetic observations show rapid (20–40 mm/year) southwestward motion in the Pingtung plain in south Taiwan and more than 10 mm/year uplift in the southern part of the Western Foothills. We use combined InSAR and CGPS measurements from 2004 to 2010 to constrain a block model of horizontal interseismic crustal deformation. Total variation regularization (TVR) serves as a tool for block model selection to algorithmically assess the block model geometry based on geodetic observations, simultaneously estimating block rotations and fault slip rates on block‐bounding faults. The block model results suggest that the margins of the Western Foothills accommodate most of the interseismic deformation in southwestern Taiwan. Thirty‐five independent blocks are required to explain interseismic crustal deformation with a mean residual velocity of 3.6 mm/year. Based on this horizontal model, we then forward predict vertical displacement and find good consistency between the predicted uplift and the geodetic observations. Our approach shows an efficient and objective way to estimate fault activities and seismic hazards in the interseismic period based on dense geodetic measurements and their uncertainties.

Reply to Comment by Jennings et al. on “Investigating Earth's Formation History Through Copper and Sulfur Metal‐Silicate Partitioning During Core‐Mantle Differentiation”
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Recognizing existing materials that can act as proxies for Earth's building blocks, and understanding the accretionary pathway taken during Earth's growth, persist as outstanding issues in need of resolution. In Mahan, Siebert, Blanchard, Badro, et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JB015991), we conducted diamond anvil cell (DAC) Cu metal‐silicate partitioning experiments and coupled these results with a large complement of literature data to characterize Cu metal‐silicate partitioning during Earth's core formation and accretion history. The Comment of Jennings, Wade, and Llovet (2019, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JB016930) contends that secondary X‐ray fluorescence, originating from the Cu holders that experiments are routinely welded to (“lift‐out” grids), compromises the novel Cu partitioning data of Mahan, Siebert, Blanchard, Badro, et al. (2018) beyond utility. To dispel these concerns and further validate our data, we have (i) investigated secondary X‐ray fluorescence effects in a Cu‐free experiment and provided a matrix‐matched data correction, and (ii) rewelded a DAC experiment from a Cu grid to a Mo grid for a comparison of compositional analyses and Cu partitioning results. Secondary fluorescence results, in fact much like the simulated results in Jennings, Wade, and Llovet (2019), indicate that this effect is essentially equal in the metal and silicate phases and therefore has no actual impact on Cu metal‐silicate partition coefficients. Moreover, Cu concentrations and partition coefficients determined using the Mo grid are statistically indistinguishable from that determined using the Cu grid. All results decisively illustrate that while secondary X‐ray fluorescence must be considered where absolute concentrations are the final objective, it has had no meaningful impact on the partitioning data and observations of Mahan, Siebert, Blanchard, Badro, et al. (2018).

Comment on “Investigating Earth's Formation History Through Copper & Sulfur Metal–Silicate Partitioning During Core‐Mantle Differentiation” by Mahan et al.
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The physical and chemical conditions of terrestrial core formation play a key role in the distribution of elements between the Earth's silicate mantle and metallic core. To explore this, Mahan, Siebert, Blanchard, Badro, et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JB015991) present experimentally‐derived partitioning data, showing how Cu distributes itself between metal and silicate at lower‐mantle PT conditions with implications for planetary accretion and core formation. Eight experiments were performed in a diamond anvil cell, and each sample was welded to a copper grid for analysis. An offset in partitioning behavior was subsequently noted between the high‐P experiments and the lower‐P data set. However, when analyzing the diamond anvil cell experiments by electron probe microanalysis, the authors did not account for the secondary fluorescence of Cu that arises from the sample holder. Using Monte Carlo simulations of X‐ray and electron transport, we show that the fluorescence of the Cu grid, originating from high‐energy continuum X‐rays emitted from the sample, makes a significant contribution to the reported measurement of Cu in both the silicate and metallic phases. This is in good agreement with previous measurements made on Cu‐free analogs. On average, around 70% of the published Cu concentrations are attributable to X‐rays that originate externally to the sample. The reported offset in KDmet‐sil at high pressures may reflect the different experimental and analytical protocol used, rather than a true pressure effect. Although adequate post hoc corrections can be made, uncertainties around the exact sample and detector geometries make it difficult to refine simulations and derive accurate correction factors for each experiment.

Probing the Northern Chile Megathrust With Seismicity: The 2014 M8.1 Iquique Earthquake Sequence
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We used data from >100 permanent and temporary seismic stations to investigate seismicity patterns related to the 1 April 2014 M8.1 Iquique earthquake in northern Chile. Applying a multistage automatic event location procedure to the seismic data, we detected and located ~19,000 foreshocks, aftershocks, and background seismicity for 1 month preceding and 9 months following the mainshock. Foreshocks skirt around the updip limit of the mainshock asperity; aftershocks occur mainly in two belts updip and downdip of it. The updip seismicity primarily locates in a zone of transitional friction on the megathrust and can be explained by preseismic stress loading due to slow‐slip processes and afterslip driven by increased Coulomb failure stress due to the mainshock and its largest aftershock. Afterslip further south also triggered aftershocks and repeating earthquakes in several EW striking streaks. We interpret the streaks as markers of surrounding creep that could indicate a change in fault mechanics and may have structural origin, caused by fluid‐induced failure along presumed megathrust corrugations. Megathrust aftershocks terminate updip below the seaward frontal prism in the outer continental wedge that probably behaves aseismically under velocity‐strengthening conditions. The inner wedge locates further landward overlying the megathrust's seismogenic zone. Further downdip, aftershocks anticorrelate with the two major afterslip patches resolved geodetically and partially correlate with increased Coulomb failure stress, overall indicating heterogeneous frictional behavior. A region of sparse seismicity at ~40‐ to 50‐km depth is followed by the deepest plate interface aftershocks at ~55‐ to 65‐km depth, which occur in two clusters of significantly different dip.

Seismic Dispersion and Attenuation in Fluid‐Saturated Carbonate Rocks: Effect of Microstructure and Pressure
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The frequency dependence of seismic properties of fully saturated rocks can be related to wave‐induced fluid flows at different scales. The elastic dispersion and attenuation of four fluid‐saturated carbonate rocks, with different microstructures, have been measured over a broad frequency range in the laboratory. The selected rocks were a presalt coquina from offshore Congo, an Urgonian limestone from Provence (France), and an Indiana limestone either intact or thermally cracked. The selected samples present a variety of pore types characteristic of carbonates, and their link with potential squirt flow dispersion was investigated. To cover a broad frequency range, forced oscillations (0.004 to 100 Hz) and ultrasonic (1 MHz) measurement techniques were performed in a triaxial cell, at various differential pressures, on the samples saturated by fluids of different viscosity. Both hydrostatic and axial oscillations were applied in order to get the different dynamic moduli. For all our samples, the drained/undrained transition and the squirt flow mechanisms were characterized experimentally, in terms of amplitude of dispersion, amount of viscoelastic attenuation, and frequency ranges. Biot‐Gassmann's theory was found to apply mainly at seismic frequencies (10–100 Hz). A potential correlation between pore type and possible squirt flow dispersion was investigated. Intragranular microporosity, with either a rimmed or uniform distribution, does not seem to generate any substantial dispersion. On the other hand, cracked intergranular cement and uncemented grain contacts seem to generate substantial squirt flow dispersion, at respectively seismic and sonic log frequencies.

Electrical Conductivity of Omphacite as a Function of Water Content and Implications for High Conductivity Anomalies in the Dabie‐Sulu UHPM Belts and Tibet
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Magnetotelluric surveys revealed high‐conductivity layers in the lower crust beneath Tibet and in the shallow part of the upper mantle relevant to continental collision extending to the Dabie‐Sulu ultrahigh‐pressure metamorphic (UHPM) belts of eastern China, which have been interpreted by the presence of aqueous fluids/partial melts or hydrous phases. However, these explanations are not consistent with their petrological features and seismic properties. Hydrogen‐bearing omphacite could be a probable candidate to explain such high‐conductivity anomalies due to its high water‐partitioning coefficient versus coexisting garnet in eclogite. In this study, we investigated electrical conductivities of Fe‐free and Fe‐bearing omphacite as a function of water content (0.005–0.122 wt.%) at 3 GPa and 500–1300 K. Our results show that water significantly enhances the electrical conductivity of omphacite, while iron facilitates conductivity by accelerating hydrogen diffusivity and lowering its activation enthalpy. Assuming a heat flow of 70 mW/m2, the high electrical anomalies observed beneath the Dabie‐Sulu UHPM belts and the Tibetan Plateau can be reasonably explained by omphacite containing 0.07 wt.% water since water content higher than 0.07 wt.% in omphacite was frequently reported in naturally collected eclogite.

Three‐Dimensional Modeling of Spontaneous and Triggered Slow‐Slip Events at the Hikurangi Subduction Zone, New Zealand
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract At the southern Hikurangi margin, New Zealand, long‐term (duration of >1 year), deep (>25 km) slow‐slip events (SSEs) occur at intervals of approximately 5 years. In contrast, along the northern and central Hikurangi margin, short‐term and shallow (<10 km) SSEs (2‐ to 3‐week duration) occur at 1‐ to 2‐year intervals. However, it is not clear what controls these differences in SSE behavior. In this study, we simulate SSEs along the entire Hikurangi subduction zone using a 3‐D model of the plate boundary incorporating a rate‐and‐state friction law with a cutoff velocity to the evolution effect. Overall, our models are able to replicate the along‐strike and depth‐dependent variations in SSE behavior at the Hikurangi margin. Our models also show that the slip velocities of the deep, long‐term SSEs increase when the slip velocities at the deeper extension of the seismogenic zone increase during the latter half of the interseismic period. By imposing static stress changes induced by the Kaikōura earthquake in the SSE regions, we also reproduce patterns of triggering of deep, long‐term SSEs that followed the earthquake. Our results further suggest that the propensity for SSE triggering via static stress transfer depends on the amplitude of perturbation and the timing with respect to the SSE cycle. Overall, both spontaneous and triggered SSEs require larger values of effective stress for deep, long‐term events (~5 MPa) compared to the shallow, short‐term events (~1 MPa). Such low effective stresses can be explained by the existence of high pore fluid pressure in these SSE source regions.

Numerical Simulation of Simultaneous Hydraulic Fracture Growth Within a Rock Layer: Implications for Stimulation of Low‐Permeability Reservoirs
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Multistage multicluster hydraulic fracturing is currently the most effective method to stimulate low‐permeability hydrocarbon reservoirs. The desired result of this stimulation technique is highly uniform growth of multiple closely spaced hydraulic fractures. In order to deepen our understanding on the competitive growth of these fractures, we have investigated the growth behaviors of multiple hydraulic fractures under different conditions. A fully coupled model with a 3‐D influence coefficient is presented for fracture growth in a rock layer, based on a combination of boundary element method and finite volume method. It is validated against classic solutions and lab experiments. The parametric analyses of dimensionless arguments to quantify the uniformity of fracture growth are performed, with varying fracture geometries and geotechnical conditions including preexisting natural fractures. The results demonstrate that fracture competition is controlled by the dimensionless toughness, the initial fracture geometric settings, and the ratio of fracture spacing to height. A higher fluid viscosity, a smaller initial length offset, and a larger spacing benefit simultaneous fracture growth for conventional bi‐wing hydraulic fractures. By contrast, single wing ones exhibit a remarkably better performance in long‐time simultaneous fracture growth at a small separation, especially at low dimensionless toughness. Under certain conditions, the closely spaced single‐wing fractures are prone to grow simultaneously and uniformly in less energy consumption. The simultaneous growth is found to be insensitive to the interference from small‐scale natural fractures. The uniform single‐wing fracture growth from the perspective of geomechanics will provide a new insight for both reservoir stimulation and formation of vein and dike swarms.

Effect of Fe3+ on Phase Relations in the Lower Mantle: Implications for Redox Melting in Stagnant Slabs
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Recent studies have revealed that Earth's deep mantle may have a wider range of oxygen fugacities than previously thought. Such a large heterogeneity might be caused by material subducted into the deep mantle. However, high‐pressure phase relations are poorly known in systems including Fe3+ at the top of the lower mantle, where the subducted slab may be stagnant. We therefore conducted high‐pressure and high‐temperature experiments using a multi‐anvil apparatus to study the phase relations in a Fe3+‐bearing system at 26 GPa and 1573–2073 K, at conditions prevailing at the top of the lower mantle. At temperatures below 1923 K, MgSiO3‐rich bridgmanite, an Fe3+‐rich oxide phase, and SiO2 coexist in the recovered sample. Quenched partial melt was observed above 1973 K, which is significantly lower than the solidus temperature of an equivalent Fe3+‐free bulk composition. The partial melt obtained from the Fe3+‐rich bulk composition has a higher iron content than coexisting bridgmanite, similar to the Fe2+‐dominant system. The results suggest that strong mantle oxygen fugacity anomalies might alter the subsolidus and melting phase relations under lower mantle conditions. We conclude that (1) a small amount of melt may be generated from an Al‐depleted region of a stagnant slab, such as subducted former banded‐iron‐formation, and (2) Fe3+ is not transported into the deep part of the lower mantle because of its incompatibility during melting.

However, high‐pressure phase relations are poorly known in systems including Fe<sup>3+</sup> at the top of the lower mantle, where the subducted slab may be stagnant. We therefore conducted high‐pressure and high‐temperature experiments using a multi‐anvil apparatus to study the phase relations in a Fe<sup>3+</sup>‐bearing system at 26 GPa and 1573–2073 K, at conditions prevailing at the top of the lower mantle. At temperatures below 1923 K, MgSiO<sub>3</sub>‐rich bridgmanite, an Fe<sup>3+</sup>‐rich oxide phase, and SiO<sub>2</sub> coexist in the recovered sample. Quenched partial melt was observed above 1973 K, which is significantly lower than the solidus temperature of an equivalent Fe<sup>3+</sup>‐free bulk composition. The partial melt obtained from the Fe<sup>3+</sup>‐rich bulk composition has a higher iron content than coexisting bridgmanite, similar to the Fe<sup>2+</sup>‐dominant system. The results suggest that strong mantle oxygen fugacity anomalies might alter the subsolidus and melting phase relations under lower mantle conditions. We conclude that (1) a small amount of melt may be generated from an Al‐depleted region of a stagnant slab, such as subducted former banded‐iron‐formation, and (2) Fe<sup>3+</sup> is not transported into the deep part of the lower mantle because of its incompatibility during melting.</p>

Relationships Between Eclogite‐Facies Mineral Assemblages, Deformation Microstructures, and Seismic Properties in the Yuka Terrane, North Qaidam Ultrahigh‐Pressure Metamorphic Belt, NW China
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract To understand the relationships between eclogite‐facies mineral assemblages, deformation microstructures, and the seismic properties of subducting oceanic crust, eclogites from the Yuka terrane, North Qaidam ultrahigh‐pressure metamorphic belt, NW China, were studied. Observations of mineral textures, deformation microstructures, and petrofabrics in the eclogites indicate that garnet, omphacite, and phengite were deformed by intracrystalline deformation (i.e., dislocation creep) during prograde metamorphism. In contrast, amphibole, which was formed by the topotactic replacement of omphacite at fluid‐present conditions, is considered to have been deformed by diffusional flow (dissolution‐precipitation creep) during amphibolite‐facies retrogression associated with exhumation. Based on the petrofabrics in the samples, the seismic properties of the eclogites were calculated depending on eclogite‐facies mineral assemblages such as garnet + omphacite, garnet + omphacite + phengite, garnet + omphacite + phengite + lawsonite, garnet + omphacite + phengite + amphibole, and garnet + omphacite + amphibole. We found that the seismic signatures of each of the eclogite‐facies mineral assemblages were different. In particular, phengite‐bearing eclogites (the garnet + omphacite + phengite/garnet + omphacite + phengite + amphibole assemblages), depending on phengite content, produced the strongest seismic anisotropy (AVp and AVs), with a strong polarization anisotropy, that was at least three times higher than bimineralic (phengite‐absent) eclogites (garnet + omphacite assemblage). Our results indicate that phengite, as a stable phase at high‐pressure and high‐temperature conditions, can play an important role in the creation of trench‐parallel seismic anisotropy in the eclogite‐facies mineral assemblages found in subduction zones.

Confirmation of a Late Miocene Subchron C4n.2n‐1r From the Eastern Qaidam Basin in the NE Tibetan Plateau
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Refining reversal ages and improving reversal patterns for the geomagnetic polarity timescale are a major task for the paleomagnetic community. The Late Miocene is a period during which the geomagnetic field experienced frequent perturbations and which dramatic environmental changes occurred. Thus, improved (sub)chron definition during this period will enable to provide additional age control points for better understanding age of paleoenvironmental changes. A prior study of the Late Miocene C4n.2n magnetic polarity zone at Ocean Drilling Program Site 1092 in the sub‐Antarctic South Atlantic Ocean has revealed the potential existence of a subchron (C4n.2n‐1r). However, this subchron has not been incorporated into the geomagnetic polarity timescale yet because its existence has not been confirmed. Moreover, the low sediment accumulation rate of 1.32 cm/kyr at Site 1092 hampers a confident estimation of the age and duration of this subchron. Here we present a high‐resolution paleomagnetic data set covering C4n.2n from the Huaitoutala section in the eastern Qaidam Basin, Northwest China, with an average sediment accumulation rate of ~22 cm/kyr. Nine reversed declination/inclination data points define a subchron near the top of C4n.2n, similar to age of reported C4n.2n‐1r at Ocean Drilling Program Site 1092. Cyclostratigraphy of the magnetic susceptibility record of the Huaitoutala section suggests that the age and duration of the C4n.2n‐1r are 7.7612–7.7554 Ma and 5.8 ± 2.1 kyr, respectively. Confirming the existence of C4n.2n‐1r from a northern hemisphere terrestrial site suggests that two geomagnetic reversals bounding this subchron have global imprints and that this subchron can potentially serve as marker for stratigraphic correlation.

Strong Ground Motion Simulation of 2016 ML6.6 Meinong, Taiwan, Earthquake Using the Empirical Green's Function Method
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The Meinong mainshock (ML6.6) occurred in southern Taiwan at 19:57:26.08 (UTC) on 5 February 2016. To study source characteristics of the mainshock, ground motions of the mainshock are simulated using the empirical Green's function method to construct a strong motion generation area (SMGA) source model. Records of the event occurred on 2 May 2010 (ML4.6) are chosen as the empirical Green's functions along with six strong motion stations surrounding the source area. Waveforms of the mainshock at all used stations are simulated utilizing the empirical Green's function method to construct a best‐fit source model by comparing the synthetic waveforms with the observed ones in the frequency range 0.2–10 Hz. The estimated SMGA is located on the NS‐striking fault plane. The size of SMGA is 7.2 km in length along the strike direction by 7.2 km in width along the dip direction. The rupture starts at the bottom left‐hand corner (i.e., southern bottom) of the SMGA and then extends radially toward the upper right‐hand corner with a rupture velocity of 2.6 km/s. The size of the SMGA and the rise time of the mainshock follow the self‐similar empirical relationship by Miyake et al. (2003, https://doi.org/10.1785/0120020183).

Pore‐scale 3D Dynamic Modeling and Characterization of Shale Samples: Considering the Effects of Thermal Maturation
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The development of shale gas necessitates accurate modeling and characterization of these complicated formations, at both small and large scales. At the small scale, the studies based on experimental techniques have uncovered that the components and pore types in shales vary dramatically. Several pore types are identified and varied when the thermal maturation of shales changes. Therefore, accurate modeling and characterization of shale samples require taking such dynamic variations into consideration. This study presents a novel, dynamic, and three‐dimensional (3D) modeling technique considering pore‐system variation when the thermal maturation changes. The technique can construct dynamic shale models based on quartet structure generation set algorithm and morphological operation. This method can include various elements available in the shale samples in a very accurate way when the dynamic processes are reproduced. To evaluate the performance of the presented technique, 12 dynamic 3D shale models of three cases are constructed. These models are then characterized by analyzing the fractions of components, and pores, pore and throat size distributions, coordination number distribution, fractal dimension, and tortuosity. Besides, gas transport in these dynamic 3D shale models is also simulated using pore network modeling to demonstrate the permeability variation of these models. Moreover, the fractions of interparticle and intraparticle pores and cementation degree are changed to further illustrate the capability of the developed algorithm. This study reveals such a dynamic modeling technique is a robust tool to construct various porous media with complicated elements and pores, which is not limited to shale samples.

1D, 2D and 3D Monte Carlo ambient noise tomography using a dense passive seismic array installed on the North Sea seabed
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract In a variety of geoscientific applications we require 3D maps of properties of the Earth's interior, and the corresponding map of uncertainties to assess their reliability. On the seabed it is common to use Scholte wave dispersion data to infer these maps using inversion‐based imaging theory. Previously we introduced a 3D fully nonlinear Monte Carlo tomography method that inverts for shear velocities directly from frequency‐dependent travel time measurements, and which improves accuracy of the results and better estimates uncertainties. Here for the first time we apply that method to real data and compare it to two of those previous methods. We cross correlated 6.5 hours of ambient noise data recorded on a dense seismic array over Grane, North Sea, and observed two Scholte wave modes. For each mode, phase velocity maps are estimated using Eikonal tomography, which are in turn used to study the shear‐wave velocity structure of the subsurface. We applied three nonlinear inversion methods to the Grane data: standard 1D depth inversions, a 2D joint inversion along a vertical cross‐section, and a fully 3D inversion. We compare the shear‐velocity and uncertainty structures estimated along the same 2D cross‐section. Thus we show that the standard 1D inversion method causes errors in the results due to independence of those 1D inversions, whereas the 2D and 3D inversions improve results by accounting for lateral spatial correlations. The 3D inversion bypasses the initial seabed Eikonal tomography step, and therefore avoids the errors it introduces into subsequent 1D and 2D inversions.

Late Paleozoic exhumation of the West Junggar Mountains, NW China
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The Tianshan and Altai mountain belts dominate the present‐day topography of Central Asia, and are major constituents of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. These mountain belts have been extensively studied using low‐temperature thermochronology to understand their uplift and exhumation history. In comparison, few studies have focussed on the spatial extent and timing of intracontinental deformation in the intervening ranges, such as the West Junggar Mountains. Apatite fission track (AFT) and apatite U–Pb dating of igneous samples from the West Junggar Mountains reveals AFT central ages ranging from latest Carboniferous to Middle Jurassic, and mean confined track lengths between 14.1 and 12.0 μm, which are negatively correlating to AFT central ages. Apatite U–Pb dating produced mid‐Carboniferous–early Permian ages within uncertainty of zircon U–Pb crystallization ages, indicating cooling to below ~450–550 °C immediately following emplacement. Thermal history modelling of our AFT data combined with published (U–Th)/He data predicts rapid cooling to <60 °C during the early–middle Permian (285–260 Ma), followed by slower cooling rates during the Mesozoic–Cenozoic. The rapid cooling event coincides with (1) the timing of major basin‐ward thrusting in the Junggar Basin adjacent to the study area and (2) exhumation in the Chinese Altai to the north. In contrast to previous studies, our results imply that the West Junggar Mountains do not record significant exhumation during the Mesozoic–Cenozoic. This suggests that Mesozoic deformation of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt was less pervasive and widespread than previously assumed.

Abstract The motion of plates leads to cycling of chemically bound water and volatiles through the Earth's interior, having consequences for arc magmatism and seismic activity at subduction zones. Tectonically exhumed peridotite at the Earth's surface provides a substantial sink for water and carbon. The natural chemical disequilibrium that exists between exposed mantle peridotite and the surface waters/atmosphere could potentially be harnessed as a negative carbon emission technology. Understanding this process is therefore critical from both a petrological and environmental perspective. Retrograde metamorphism is physically complex, potentially involving an interplay between positive (cracking) and negative (clogging) feedbacks that may limit, or promote, fluid supply to unreacted minerals. Modeling studies are important in helping to constrain the conditions that control the extent of reaction in ultramafic rocks. This study builds on a previously reported model that describes olivine hydration/carbonation in a poro‐elastic medium, coupling fluid flow, elastic deformation, and mass transfer between chemically active phases. Here we extend this model to include brittle failure, which is crucial given the widely held hypothesis that reaction‐driven cracking is the dominant positive feedback in these processes. Here we explore the use of phase‐field methods to simulate brittle failure in a poro‐elastic medium, in the context of hydration (serpentinization) of peridotite. We show that reaction‐driven cracking in this model can generate a positive feedback that, under certain conditions, can lead to 100% transformation of olivine to serpentine.

Seismicity, fault slip rates, and fault interactions in a fault system
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Seismicity and the partitioning of slip rates in interacting and mechanically coupled fault systems are poorly understood. We developed and used three‐dimensional viscoelastoplastic finite element models to simulate earthquakes, earthquake cycles, and synthetic seismicity in single and bifurcated fault systems, and investigate seismicity, fault slip rates, interactions and mechanical coupling between faults in fault systems. The modeled interseismic velocities and coseismic displacements are consistent with those from analytical and quasi‐analytical solutions. We found that the modeled frequency‐magnitude relation satisfies the Gutenberg‐Richter relation and the b value is inversely related to differential stress. We observed that the seismicity on two parallel faults is often interdependent and complementary: high seismic moment release rates on a fault are usually accompanied by low ones on the other fault, and vice versa; the two faults collectively accommodate far‐field tectonic loading and crustal relative motion. Model results showed that when two parallel faults have the same or similar strength, they have similar seismicity and long‐term slip rates, but when one of the two faults has lower strength, it has more active seismicity and a faster slip rate than the other; the sum of their slip rates equals the far‐field crustal relative motion in both cases. The results in this study provide scientific insights into the spatiotemporal migration of seismicity and partitioning of fault slip rates in an interacting and mechanically coupled fault system, and help to qualify b values and to evaluate the earthquake hazard and risk on each of the faults in such a system.

Ancient refertilization process preserved in the plagioclase peridotites: an example from the Shuanggou ophiolite, southwest China
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Petrology, geochemistry, platinum group elements (PGEs: Os, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, and Pd) and Re‐Os isotope data of harzburgites and plagioclase lherzolites from the Shuanggou ophiolite (southwest China) are presented in this study, in order to determine whether ancient refertilization process can be preserved in ophiolitic plagioclase peridotites. The harzburgites in the Shuanggou ophiolite are divided into two groups: (1) the Group‐1 harzburgites have 187Os/188Os ratios (0.12297~0.12727) and PGE abundances similar to those of oceanic peridotites, thereby representing the convecting upper mantle; (2) the Group‐2 harzburgites have extremely low 187Os/188Os ratios (0.11307~0.11651) with considerable fractionation in IPGEs (Iridium‐group PGEs: Os, Ir, and Ru), indicative of an ancient refractory mantle in the oceanic lithosphere. The plagioclase lherzolites were formed by melt impregnation of the Group‐2 harzburgites, according to the PGE compositions and the petrographic features. However, the large Os isotope difference between the lherzolites (187Os/188Os: 0.12470~0.12666) and the Group‐2 harzburgites indicates that the refertilization process took place much earlier than the exhumation of the mantle at 0.4 Ga. In addition, clinopyroxene composition suggests that the percolating melt is different from the Shuanggou diabases and typical mid‐ocean‐ridge basalts. This study therefore demonstrates that some plagioclase lherzolites possibly were not related to mantle exhumation beneath the spreading center, but formed by much older melt impregnation processes in the mantle instead.

Seismic tomography using variational inference methods
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Seismic tomography is a methodology to image the interior of solid or fluid media, and is often used to map properties in the subsurface of the Earth. In order to better interpret the resulting images it is important to assess imaging uncertainties. Since tomography is significantly nonlinear, Monte Carlo sampling methods are often used for this purpose, but they are generally computationally intractable for large datasets and high‐dimensional parameter spaces. To extend uncertainty analysis to larger systems we use variational inference methods to conduct seismic tomography. In contrast to Monte Carlo sampling, variational methods solve the Bayesian inference problem as an optimization problem, yet still provide probabilistic results. In this study, we applied two variational methods, automatic differential variational inference (ADVI) and Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), to 2D seismic tomography problems using both synthetic and real data and we compare the results to those from two different Monte Carlo sampling methods. The results show that ADVI provides a biased approximation because of its implicit Gaussian approximation, and cannot be used to find multi‐modal posteriors; SVGD can produce more accurate approximations to the results of Monte Carlo sampling methods. Both methods estimate the posterior distribution at significantly lower computational cost, provided that gradients of parameters with respect to data can be calculated efficiently. We expect that the methods can be applied fruitfully to many other types of geophysical inverse problems.

Magma oscillations in a conduit‐reservoir system, application to very long period (VLP) seismicity at basaltic volcanoes–Part II: Data inversion and interpretation at Kīlauea Volcano
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Very long period (VLP) seismic events (with dominant periods of 15 to 40 s), observed from 2007 to 2018 at the summit of Kīlauea Volcano, Hawai`i, arise from resonant oscillations in the shallow magma plumbing system. Utilizing an oscillation model developed in the companion paper [Liang et al., 2019], we perform Bayesian inversions on seismic data from four representative VLP events separately for the parameters of the shallow conduit‐reservoir system, exploring both sphere and crack reservoir geometries. Both sphere and crack geometries are preferentially located ~ 1‐2 km beneath the northeast edge of Halema`uma`u crater and produce similar fits to the data. Considering a reasonable range for reservoir storativity, magma density, and density contrast between the top and bottom of the conduit, we favor a spherical reservoir with a radius of 0.8 to 1.2 km and a short conduit of less than a few hundred meters. For this geometry, buoyancy from density stratification in the conduit provides the dominant restoring force for the VLP oscillation. Viscosity is constrained within an order of magnitude for each event (e.g., approximately 2 to 23 Pa s for one event versus 27 to 513 Pa s for another). Changes in VLP period T and quality factor Q can be explained by changes in viscosity, density stratification, and/or conduit/reservoir geometry. In particular, observed fluctuations in Q over short time intervals (e.g., hours) with minimal changes in T apparently require rapid changes of magma viscosity by over an order of magnitude, assuming geometry remains unchanged, possibly reflecting changes in volatile content, bubble concentration, or conduit flow regime.

Magma oscillations in a conduit‐reservoir system, application to very long period (VLP) seismicity at basaltic volcanoes–Part I: Theory
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Very long period (VLP, 2‐100 s) seismic signals at basaltic volcanoes like Kilauea, Hawai`i, and Mount Erebus, Antarctica, are likely from resonant oscillations of magma within the shallow plumbing system. The system consists of conduits connected to cracks (dikes and sills) or reservoirs of other shapes. A quantitative understanding of wave propagation and resonance in a coupled conduit‐crack system is required to interpret observations. In this work, we idealize the system as an axisymmetric conduit coupled to a tabular crack, accounting for fluid inertia, compressibility, and viscosity, buoyancy, and crack wall elasticity. We perform time‐domain simulations and eigenmode analyses of the governing equations, linearized about a rest state. The fundamental mode or conduit‐reservoir mode reflects the balance of conduit magma inertia with buoyancy (and, for small cracks, crack wall elasticity). Magma oscillates in an effectively incompressible manner within the conduit, deflating and inflating the crack, which couples to the surrounding solid to produce observable surface displacements. For sufficiently low viscosity magmas, viscous effects are confined to boundary layers. Shorter period modes are primarily reverberating crack waves with negligible coupling to the conduit. Finally, we introduce an approximate reduced model for the conduit‐reservoir mode, which can also handle more general reservoir geometries (e.g., spherical chambers). The reduced model connects the observable VLP period and quality factor to two uniquely constrained parameters: the inviscid oscillation period T0 and the viscous diffusion time 𝜏vis across the conduit radius. Our models can be extended to study the seismic response of more complex magmatic systems.

Joint inversion of receiver functions and surface‐wave dispersion in the Pantanal Wetlands: Implications for basin formation
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The origin and evolution of the Pantanal Basin has been investigated through velocity‐depth profiles developed from the joint inversion of receiver functions and surface‐wave dispersion velocities at 33 broadband stations. The Pantanal Basin is a shallow and wide depression in South‐Central Brazil that developed within the Andean foreland in response to loads and flexural bending of the South American plate. Our results reveal the existence of up to four different crustal types that correlate with surface geology: (i) crust of 35 km with VS<4.0 km/s, under the basin and along the SW projection of the Transbrasiliano Lineament (TBL); (ii) crust of 45 km with VS>4.0 km/s below 40 km depth, flanking the basin to the East and West; (iii) crust of 50‐55 km with VS>4.0 km/s below 40 km depth, flanking the basin to the North and South and along the TBL; and (iv) crust of 42.5‐45.0 km with VS<4.0 km/s in the neighboring Paraná Basin. Existing geodynamic models propose that the Pantanal Basin formed either in the backbulge of the flexural system or at the top of the forebulge, due to extensional bending stresses that reactivated pre‐existing faults in the shallow upper crust. We argue that the Pantanal Basin formed in a structurally weaker portion of the foreland crust that was affected by delamination and enhanced bending of the South American plate. Our findings do not allow for discrimination among the competing models but suggest the TBL was critical in marking the location, origin and evolution of this basin.

Nonlinear suppression of high‐frequency S waves by the near‐field velocity pulse with reference to the 2002 Denali earthquake
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The near‐field velocity pulse of large strike‐slip earthquakes brings near‐fault stiff crystalline rock into failure. The uppermost ~2 km beneath Pump Station 10 (PS10) likely failed nonlinearly during the 2002 Denali earthquake. High‐frequency S waves traversed this region during and immediately after failure with only weak waves reaching the surface. In contrast, high‐frequency S waves were briefly weak at station LUC only during the strong near‐field velocity pulse of the 1992 Landers earthquake. The observed horizontal spectra during the near‐field velocity pulse at PS10 decreased exponentially with frequency with a low apparently constant Q of ~20. This observation is incompatible with simple elastic‐plastic and nonlinear viscoelastic rheologies that do not preferentially attenuate high frequencies. Candidate rheologies involve heterogeneous crystalline rock masses where nonlinear domains act in parallel. Maxwell (spring and dash pot) elements in parallel produce apparently constant Q over a range of frequencies. This rheology may arise from pseudolinear inelastic interaction of weak stresses from high‐frequency S waves with strong low‐frequency stresses from the near‐field velocity pulse. Alternatively, inelastic deformation associated with the high‐frequency waves may interact nonlinearly with low‐frequency deformation associated with healing of damage associated with the near‐field velocity pulse. The latter process is attractive for the PS10 signal which remained weak after the near‐field velocity pulse had passed. We unsuccessfully examined aftershock records for healing of damage within the uppermost crystalline rock.

Partly cloudy with a chance of lava flows: forecasting volcanic eruptions in the 21st century
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract A primary goal of volcanology is forecasting hazardous eruptive activity. Despite much progress over the last century, however, volcanoes still erupt with no detected precursors, lives and livelihoods are lost to eruptive activity, and forecasting the onsets of eruptions remains fraught with uncertainty. Long‐term forecasts are generally derived from the geological and historical records, from which recurrence intervals and styles of activity can be inferred, while shorter‐term forecasts are derived from patterns in monitoring data. Information from geology and monitoring data can be evaluated and combined using statistical analysis, expert elicitation, and various conceptual and or mathematical models. Integrative frameworks, such as event trees, combine this diversity of information to produce probabilistic forecasts that can inform the style and scale of the societal response to a potential future eruption. Several developments show promise to revolutionize the utility and accuracy of these forecasts. These include growth in the quantity and quality of multidisciplinary monitoring data, coupled with increases in computing power; machine learning algorithms, which will allow far better utilization of this growing volume of data; and new physiochemical volcano models and data assimilation algorithms, which take advantage of a wide range of monitoring data and realistic physics to better predict the evolution of a given physical state. Although most eruption forecasts may never be as reliable as weather forecasts, and great caution must be exercised when attempting to predict highly complex volcanic behavior, these and other innovations—particularly when combined in integrative, fully probabilistic forecasting frameworks—should help volcanologists to better issue warnings of volcanic activity on societally relevant timeframes.

Onset and cause of increased seismic activity near Pecos, West Texas, USA from observations at the Lajitas TXAR Seismic Array
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract In recent years, numerous small earthquakes have occurred near the town of Pecos in West Texas; however, when this activity began and whether it was caused by increased petroleum industry activity has been uncertain because prior to 2017 there were few permanent seismograph stations in the region. We identify and locate earthquakes using data recorded since 2000 at TXAR, a sensitive 10‐station seismic array situated about 240 km south of Pecos. We thus show that in 2007 one earthquake occurred near Pecos, in 2009 several more occurred, and subsequently activity has increased considerably, with more than 2000 events identified in 2017. A time‐of‐day and year‐by‐year analysis identifies geographic areas in West Texas where events are likely to be natural earthquakes and quarry blasts. However, for the Pecos events, annual seismicity rates increase along with annual volumes of petroleum production and fluid waste disposal, suggesting a causal link. Analysis of seismograms collected by the EarthScope Transportable Array indicates the 2009 earthquakes had focal depths of 4.0‐5.2 km below sea level, within or just below strata where petroleum is produced and/or wastewater is injected. The largest earthquake to date had magnitude ML3.7, but the recent high activity rates suggest that greater magnitudes may be possible. For the years 2000‐2017, we provide a catalog of 10,753 epicenters of seismic events recorded at TXAR.

Seismic Structure of the Antarctic Upper Mantle Based on Adjoint Tomography
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract The upper mantle and transition zone beneath Antarctica and the surrounding oceans are amongst the poorest‐imaged regions of the Earth's interior. Over the last 15 years, several large broadband regional seismic arrays have been deployed, as have new permanent seismic stations. Using data from 297 Antarctic and 26 additional seismic stations south of ~40°S, we image the seismic structure of the upper mantle and transition zone using adjoint tomography. Over the course of 20‐iterations, we utilize phase observations from three‐component seismograms containing P, S, Rayleigh, and Love waves, including reflections and overtones, generated by 270 earthquakes that occurred during 2001‐2003 and 2007‐2016. The new continental‐scale seismic model (ANT‐20) possesses regional‐scale resolution south of 60° S. In East Antarctica, thinner continental lithosphere is found beneath areas of Dronning Maud Land and the Rayner province characterized by Proterozoic and Phanerozoic orogenic activity, suggesting partial destruction of the lithosphere. A continuous low velocity anomaly extends from the Balleny Islands through the western Ross Embayment, delineating areas of Cenozoic extension. Slow velocity anomalies are also imaged beneath Marie Byrd Land and along the Amundsen Sea Coast, extending to the Antarctic Peninsula. These anomalies are confined to the upper 200‐250 km of the mantle, except beneath Marie Byrd Land where they extend into the transition zone and possibly the uppermost lower mantle. In addition, slow velocity anomalies along the Amundsen Sea Coast link up with deeper anomalies offshore, suggesting a possible connection with deeper mantle processes.

Origin and transformation of light hydrocarbons ascending at an active pockmark on Vestnesa Ridge, Arctic Ocean
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We report on the geochemistry of hydrocarbons and pore waters down to 62.5 mbsf, collected by drilling with the MARUM‐MeBo70 and by gravity coring at the Lunde pockmark in the Vestnesa Ridge. Our data document the origin and transformations of volatiles feeding gas emissions previously documented in this region. Gas hydrates are present where a fracture network beneath the pockmark focusses migration of thermogenic hydrocarbons characterized by their C1/C2+ and stable isotopic compositions (δ2H‐CH4, δ13C‐CH4). Measured geothermal gradients (~80°C km‐1) and known formation temperatures (>70°C) suggest that those hydrocarbons are formed at depths >800 mbsf. A combined analytical/modeling approach, including concentration and isotopic mass balances, reveals that pockmark sediments experience diffuse migration of thermogenic hydrocarbons. However, at sites without channeled flow this appears to be limited to depths > ~50 mbsf. At all sites we document a contribution of microbial methanogenesis to the overall carbon cycle that includes a component of secondary carbonate reduction (CR) – i.e. reduction of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) generated by anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in the uppermost methanogenic zone. AOM and CR rates are spatially variable within the pockmark and are highest at high‐flux sites. These reactions are revealed by δ13C‐DIC depletions at the sulfate‐methane interface at all sites. However, δ13C‐CH4 depletions are only observed at the low methane flux sites because changes in the isotopic composition of the overall methane pool are masked at high‐flux sites. 13C‐depletions of TOC suggest that at seeps sites, methane‐derived carbon is incorporated into de novo synthesized biomass.

Near‐fault velocity spectra from laboratory failures and their relation to natural ground motion
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract We compared near‐fault velocity spectra recorded during laboratory experiments to that of natural earthquakes. We fractured crystalline rock samples at room temperature and intermediate confining pressure (50 MPa). Subsequently slip events were generated on the fracture surfaces under higher confinement (300 MPa). Velocity spectra from rock fracture resemble the inverse frequency (1/f) decay of natural earthquake velocity. This spectrum can be attributed to fault creation via seismic fracturing over a wide range of spatial scales. In contrast, subsequent slips on the rough fracture surfaces are depleted in high frequency energy and fall off approximately as 1/f2. The 1/f2 spectrum is more consistent with a slider‐block model obeying static‐kinetic friction than a natural earthquake. The depleted high frequency content precludes the rough fault experiments from being directly analogous to natural sources. The suppression of high frequencies may have resulted from two possible factors: 1) the presence of a well‐developed shear zone and coseismic damping of the fault motion by dissipation within it, or, our favored interpretation, 2) a smaller amount of energy dissipated by shearing relative to the total energy release at elevated confining pressure. In context of the latter explanation, a unifying concept that applies to these experiments, earthquakes, ground motion and to models of complex radiated motion is that high frequency radiated energy is enhanced when total energy release is nearly balanced within the source region by dissipative processes. This near‐critical energy release condition can be accessed at low normal stress in laboratory experiments.

Evidence for a deep hydrologic cycle on oceanic transform faults
</title>
<dc:description>
Abstract Oceanic transform faults represent abundant, yet relatively unexplored components of the hydrologic cycle in the mantle lithosphere. Current models limit fluid circulation to 600 °C, the thermal limit of earthquakes recorded by teleseismic surveys. However, recent ocean‐bottom seismic surveys have documented earthquakes extending to >1000 °C in modeled thermal structure. To establish constraints on the depth extent of brittle deformation and fluid infiltration, we analyzed peridotite mylonites dredged from the Shaka Transform Fault, Southwest Indian Ridge. Samples range from high strain mylonites that preserve ductile microstructures to lower strain mylonites that are fractured and overprinted by hydrothermal alteration. Microstructural analyses of the high strain samples reveal brittle deformation in pyroxene concomitant with ductile deformation in olivine and growth of amphibole. Porphyroclasts preserve healed fractures filled with fluid inclusions, implying repeated episodes of fracture, fluid infiltration and healing. The association of hydration features with brittle structures points to seawater, rather than melt, as the fluid source. Textural analysis indicates that strain localization was initiated by grain boundary pinning and that olivine grain size was reduced in the presence of amphibole. Comparing the amphibole stability field to thermometry estimates for the limit of recrystallization suggests that fluid flow extended to ~650‐850 °C. Our results indicate that the hydrologic cycle extends past the brittle‐ductile transition and promotes strain localization via hydrolytic weakening and hydration reactions. We propose that seawater infiltration on oceanic transform faults is driven by the seismic cycle and represents a first order control on the rheology of the oceanic lithosphere.

Comparing the amphibole stability field to thermometry estimates for the limit of recrystallization suggests that fluid flow extended to ~650‐850 °C. Our results indicate that the hydrologic cycle extends past the brittle‐ductile transition and promotes strain localization via hydrolytic weakening and hydration reactions. We propose that seawater infiltration on oceanic transform faults is driven by the seismic cycle and represents a first order control on the rheology of the oceanic lithosphere.</p>
